      In 2019, Hadjar made his single-seater debut in the {wikiLink("French F4 Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_French_F4_Championship")}. Despite struggling to push down fully on the car's pedals owing to his low height at the start of the season, Hadjar was able to achieve his first single-seater win at {wikiLink("Spa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_Spa-Francorchamps")} during the third round. Hadjar earned another podium at the {wikiLink("Circuit de Lédenon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_L%C3%A9denon")}, with a second place in the final race. The final three rounds of the season were hampered by three retirements, but he still managed to score a decent haul of points to finish seventh in the standings, claiming second in the junior class to {wikiLink("Victor Bernier", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Bernier")}.

      Hadjar then once again drove in the {wikiLink("French F4 Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_French_F4_Championship")}. Scoring a podium on debut, Hadjar scored regular rostrums in the first half of the season but did not win. However, in the penultimate round in {wikiLink("Paul Ricard", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_Paul_Ricard")}, Hadjar scored a pole position and held off {wikiLink("Ayumu Iwasa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayumu_Iwasa")} to win his first race of the year. Hadjar would also win the third race of the round after another battle with Iwasa. At the third Paul Ricard round, he took the victor honors for a third time during the first race; he finished fifth and sixth in the final two races. With eight further podiums, two pole positions, and three wins, Hadjar finished third in the drivers' standings with 233 points, being the highest-placed {wikiLink("French driver", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people")}.

      Hadjar made his debut at the {wikiLink("Formula Regional", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_Regional")} level in 2021, competing in the first three rounds of the {wikiLink("F3 Asian Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_F3_Asian_Championship")} with {wikiLink("Evans GP", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evans_GP")}. He impressed right from the start, scoring a podium finish during the opening round in {wikiLink("Dubai Autodrome", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai_Autodrome")}. During the second round at {wikiLink("Yas Marina", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yas_Marina_Circuit")}, Hadjar demonstrated strong pace and finished on the podium in all three rounds. Hadjar scored another third place during the final race of the third round. Despite not taking part in the latter rounds of the campaign, Hadjar managed to finish sixth in the standings, highest of all part-time entrants.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hadjar's main campaign would lie in the {wikiLink("Formula Regional European Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Formula_Regional_European_Championship")}, where he partnered {wikiLink("Zane Maloney", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zane_Maloney")}, {wikiLink("Léna Bühler", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9na_B%C3%BChler")}, and fellow countryman {wikiLink("Hadrien David", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrien_David")}, at {wikiLink("R-ace GP", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-ace_GP")}. Hadjar scored his first points, along with his first rookie win, at the first round in {wikiLink("Imola", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola_Circuit")}. He then proceeded to score his first podium at the next event in {wikiLink("Barcelona", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_Barcelona-Catalunya")}, and achieved his first Formula Regional victory in the first race on the streets of {wikiLink("Monaco", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_Monaco")}, from pole position. In that same weekend Hadjar finished second in race two, only behind teammate Maloney, and closed in on the championship lead held by {wikiLink("Grégoire Saucy", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%A9goire_Saucy")}. However, Hadjar would be unable to score a podium finish until the final round of the season, despite amassing a number of finishes in the top six. Following a disappointing round at {wikiLink("Mugello", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mugello_Circuit")} where he hadn't scored any points, Hadjar bounced back with a double podium in that final round at {wikiLink("Monza", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monza_Circuit")}, scoring a win in the second race after the leading pair collided. Hadjar ended up fifth in the standings, just four points behind teammate Maloney, and won the honours for the best rookie of the season.

    <p>
      In November 2021, Hadjar drove for {wikiLink("Hitech Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitech_Grand_Prix")} in the {wikiLink("FIA Formula 3", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_FIA_Formula_3_Championship")} post-season test. He would eventually be announced to drive for the team in the {wikiLink("2022 season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIA_Formula_3_Championship")} in January. He started his season out in the best way possible, inheriting victory in the {wikiLink("Sakhir", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Sakhir_Formula_3_round")} sprint race after original winner {wikiLink("Oliver Bearman", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Bearman")} had received a five-second time penalty for track limits infringements. The feature race would be less successful, as Hadjar finished 25th after suffering a puncture caused by contact with {wikiLink("Alexander Smolyar", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Smolyar")}. Qualifying seventh in {wikiLink("Imola", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Imola_Formula_3_round")}, Hadjar made his way to the podium places in the sprint race, but a collision with {wikiLink("Caio Collet", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caio_Collet")} on the last lap dropped him to fifth place. Hadjar returned to the podium during the feature race, benefitting from a last corner collision between Bearman and {wikiLink("Grégoire Saucy", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%A9goire_Saucy")} to finish third.
    </p>

    <p>
      A fourth place in qualifying followed in {wikiLink("Barcelona", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Barcelona_Formula_3_round")}, he battled in the lower end of the points and finished tenth. He would finish third the next day, after Hadjar passed Smolyar at the start of lap 1. A mistake on his qualifying lap confined him to ninth on the grid. In the sprint race, he moved up two places to second in the first half of the race before overtaking {wikiLink("Victor Martins", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Martins")} on the penultimate lap, allowing Hadjar to take his second win before finishing fifth on Sunday following a fierce fight with fellow Red Bull junior {wikiLink("Jak Crawford", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_Crawford")}. Hadjar made overtakes to finish fifth in the feature race.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hadjar put himself into championship contention by taking pole in {wikiLink("Spielberg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Spielberg_Formula_3_round")}. After scoring one point on Saturday, Hadjar converted his pole into a lights-to-flag feature race win in rainy conditions. Hadjar qualified tenth in {wikiLink("Hungary", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Budapest_Formula_3_round")} and moved up to second in the sprint race, but a mistake saw him slip to fourth place. Hadjar experienced a challenging race on Sunday as a poor start meant he ended up in 18th.
    </p>

    <p>
      A mixed-weather qualifying session at {wikiLink("Spa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Spa-Francorchamps_Formula_3_round")} yielded a disappointing 23rd place for Hadjar, though he progressed enough to score two points in the sprint race, where he finished ninth. Hadjar lost the championship lead at the penultimate round in {wikiLink("Zandvoort", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Zandvoort_Formula_3_round")}, despite scoring a sixth and fifth place in the races.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a close championship fight between seven drivers, Hadjar put a dent into his title aspirations by crashing at the final corner during qualifying in {wikiLink("Monza", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Monza_Formula_3_round")}, meaning he would start from 16th. Contact with {wikiLink("Kush Maini", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kush_Maini")} during the sprint race necessitated a front wing change, which left him down in 27th. He would finish ninth on Sunday, meaning that Hadjar finished fourth in the drivers' standings, with three wins, one pole, five podiums, and 123 points.

    <p>
      Having tested for Hitech at the 2022 F2 post-season test at {wikiLink("Yas Marina", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yas_Marina_Circuit")}, Hadjar joined the team for the {wikiLink("2023 Formula 2 season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Formula_2_Championship")} alongside his then fellow {wikiLink("Red Bull junior", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Junior_Team")} {wikiLink("Jak Crawford", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_Crawford")}. On debut in {wikiLink("Bahrain", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Sakhir_Formula_2_round")}, Hadjar qualified 14th and finished 20th on Saturday after struggling with his tyres, but ended up seventh in the feature race.
      He scored more points in {wikiLink("Jeddah", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Jeddah_Formula_2_round")}, finishing ninth on Sunday after qualifying 19th. He then qualified fourth at {wikiLink("Albert Park", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Melbourne_Formula_2_round")} and finished sixth on Saturday, but finished outside of the points on Sunday after suffering front wing damage due to contact with {wikiLink("Oliver Bearman", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Bearman")} during a pit stop, as well as a subsequent penalty.
      This was followed up by a charge from 18th to eighth in the {wikiLink("Baku", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Baku_Formula_2_round")} sprint race, though he was demoted to 11th for illegally overtaking {wikiLink("Jack Doohan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Doohan")} during the safety car restart. He bounced back by finishing seventh in the feature race after trying an alternative strategy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hadjar qualified tenth in {wikiLink("Monaco", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Monte_Carlo_Formula_2_round")} meaning he would start the sprint from pole; he led until lap 6 when a mechanical failure put him out of the race. He subsequently finished 12th in the feature race and later experienced another scoreless weekend in {wikiLink("Barcelona", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Barcelona_Formula_2_round")}.
      Hadjar qualified 21st in {wikiLink("Austria", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Spielberg_Formula_2_round")} and took a gamble in the sprint race, starting on slick tyres on a drying track. This paid off as he progressed to fourth by the chequered flag, before being promoted to third following a disqualification for {wikiLink("Clément Novalak", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cl%C3%A9ment_Novalak")}. In the feature race Hadjar finished 12th.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hadjar qualified ninth in {wikiLink("Silverstone", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Silverstone_Formula_2_round")}, where he battled for the podium spots in the sprint race but eventually finished fifth. A poor strategy choice in the feature race led to a finish outside of the points.
      Hadjar qualified fifth in {wikiLink("Hungary", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Budapest_Formula_2_round")}, and he held off championship leader {wikiLink("Frederik Vesti", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederik_Vesti")} to finish eighth in the sprint race. In his best Sunday showing of the year thus far, Hadjar ended where he started in fifth.
    </p>

    <p>
      A week later, Hadjar crashed into the pit exit wall during the feature race in {wikiLink("Spa-Francorchamps", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Spa-Francorchamps_Formula_2_round")}, ending his chance for points. He started the {wikiLink("Zandvoort", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Zandvoort_Formula_2_round")} sprint race from the front and held the lead as a multi-car accident caused the race to be halted; the subsequent rain shower led to the event's abandonment, as Hadjar was awarded victory but no points as less than two racing laps had been completed.
      He finished the feature race in sixth place. A frustrating weekend at {wikiLink("Monza", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Monza_Formula_2_round")} followed, as Hadjar qualified fourth but failed to score points during the races, most notably damaging his front wing on the opening lap of the feature race.
      At the season finale in {wikiLink("Yas Marina", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Yas_Island_Formula_2_round")} Hadjar ran second in the opening laps of the sprint race, though he eventually dropped to fifth by the end. Hadjar ended his season with an eighth place in the feature race, his second double-points result of the season.

    <p>
      In {wikiLink("Jeddah", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Jeddah_Formula_2_round")}, Hadjar experienced a woeful weekend as he was forced to retire from the sprint whilst running sixth on the penultimate lap due to an engine issue and retired again on Sunday with another issue.

      Hadjar qualified eighth in {wikiLink("Melbourne", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Melbourne_Formula_2_round")}. At the start of the sprint race, Hadjar wedged his teammate Martí into Bortoleto whilst taking the lead. He then dominated the sprint to win his first race in F2, but was demoted to sixth after being given a 10-second penalty for the incident. In the feature race, Hadjar passed multiple cars following a safety car interruption and held the net race lead thereafter to claim his first victory. After the victory, {wikiLink("Le Parisien", "https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Parisien")} described Hadjar as "Petit {wikiLink("Prost", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Prost")}."

      Hadjar's impressive qualifying form continued into {wikiLink("Imola", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Imola_Formula_2_round")}, where he qualified third. He was involved in a multi-car collision during the opening lap of the sprint race, which took him out of the running. Despite that, he bounced back by winning his second successive feature event, having taken the lead following a slow pit stop for {wikiLink("Oliver Bearman", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Bearman")} before defending against Bortoleto in the dying laps.

      Hadjar qualified third in {wikiLink("Monaco", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Monte_Carlo_Formula_2_round")} again, finishing the sprint race in eighth. Another Sunday win looked on the cards as he led after polesitter {wikiLink("Richard Verschoor", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Verschoor")} suffered with car issues, but a late {wikiLink("virtual safety car (VSC)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car#virtual_safety_car_(VSC)")} on the penultimate lap allowed {wikiLink("Zak O'Sullivan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_O%27Sullivan")} to make his mandatory pit stop and come out ahead of Hadjar, who ended up finishing second.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hadjar's good run of form was stopped as he qualified 11th at {wikiLink("Barcelona", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Barcelona_Formula_2_round")}, though he managed to finish sixth and fifth in the races. Hadjar then qualified seventh in {wikiLink("Austria", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Spielberg_Formula_2_round")} after experiencing an engine failure during the session; a subsequent issue with the new engine forced the team to run it with limited power. The problem was rectified before Sunday's race, where Hadjar finished third after a battle with teammate Martí before being passed by {wikiLink("Franco Colapinto", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_Colapinto")} on the last lap.

      A week later, Hadjar took his first F2 pole for {wikiLink("Silverstone", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Silverstone_Formula_2_round")}. He retired from the sprint after spinning out at Copse corner on lap 8. Despite a slow start, Hadjar bounced back to win the feature race, inheriting victory after {wikiLink("Jak Crawford", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_Crawford")} had been penalised for an unsafe release; this put Hadjar into the lead of the championship.

    <p>
      Hadjar qualified third in {wikiLink("Hungary", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Budapest_Formula_2_round")}. In the sprint race, despite starting on the soft tyres, Hadjar managed them well to finish fourth on the road, before being promoted to the rostrum due to a disqualification for original winner Verschoor. However, Hadjar was forced to start from the pit lane on Sunday and he eventually finished 18th. Hadjar qualified third in {wikiLink("Belgium", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Spa-Francorchamps_Formula_2_round")} and finished the shortened sprint in ninth. For the feature race, Hadjar took the lead on lap 8 and held off title rival Bortoleto after their pit stops to take his fourth win of the season, leaving him with a 36-point lead over Bortoleto going into the summer break.

    <p>
      However, the following round at {wikiLink("Monza", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Monza_Formula_2_round")} yielded no points for Hadjar, despite qualifying on the front row. After finishing tenth in the sprint race, his luck took a turn for the worse when he pitted just before the safety car deployment, causing him to lose positions. In contrast, Bortoleto benefitted from the safety car to win the feature race.
    </p>

    <p>
      He started 20th in both {wikiLink("Baku", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Baku_Formula_2_round")} races after crashing turn 1 during qualifying due to overheating brakes. His low starting position meant Hadjar failed to score points again, causing Bortoleto to pass him in the standings. After a two-month break, Hadjar qualified ninth for the round in {wikiLink("Qatar", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Lusail_Formula_2_round")}, meaning he started second on Saturday. He passed {wikiLink("Oliver Bearman", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Bearman")} on lap 2 of the sprint and built up a three-second lead before his tyres ran out and he was repassed by Bearman on lap 21. Hadjar then spun, dropping to fourth by the flag. In the feature race Hadjar benefitted from a safety car that allowed him to jump up to third place behind title rivals Bortoleto and {wikiLink("Paul Aron", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Aron")}. Bortoleto received a penalty for crossing the pit entry line and Hadjar was promoted to second at the finish, allowing him to reduce Bortoleto's lead to half a point going into the season finale.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hadjar qualified fourth in {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Yas_Island_Formula_2_round")} and finished fifth on Saturday, after suffering front wing damage on the first lap after contact with {wikiLink("Kush Maini", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kush_Maini")}. Though Hadjar was promoted to third on the feature race grid after Aron was forced to start from the pit lane, it would be for naught as Hadjar stalled at the start of the feature race; with Bortoleto finishing second, the Brazilian took the title, condemning Hadjar to finish second overall. On his title loss, Hadjar said "all that hard work for this to happen, I can't believe it, this is the worst moment of my life". Hadjar would end his final F2 season as runner-up in the Drivers' Championship, finishing with four wins, eight podiums, one pole position, one fastest lap, and 192 points compared to teammate Marti's 62.
