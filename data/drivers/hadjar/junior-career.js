      Having tested for Hitech at the 2022 F2 post-season test at {wikiLink("Yas Marina", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yas_Marina_Circuit")}, Hadjar joined the team for the {wikiLink("2023 Formula 2 season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Formula_2_Championship")} alongside his then fellow {wikiLink("Red Bull junior", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Junior_Team")} {wikiLink("Jak Crawford", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_Crawford")}.<sup id="cite_ref-80" className="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80"><span className="cite-bracket">[</span>78<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-81" className="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81"><span className="cite-bracket">[</span>79<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> On debut in {wikiLink("Bahrain", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Sakhir_Formula_2_round")}, Hadjar qualified 14th and finished 20th on Saturday after struggling with his tyres, but ended up seventh in the feature race.<sup id="cite_ref-82" className="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82"><span className="cite-bracket">[</span>80<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-83" className="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>81<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-84" className="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>82<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

    <p>
      Hadjar switched to {wikiLink("Campos Racing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campos_Racing")} for the {wikiLink("2024 Formula 2 season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Formula_2_Championship")}, teaming up with fellow {wikiLink("Red Bull junior", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Junior_Team")} {wikiLink("Pepe Martí", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Mart%C3%AD")}.
    </p>

    <p>
      After qualifying second in {wikiLink("Sakhir", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Sakhir_Formula_2_round")}, he moved up through the field and finished the sprint race in fourth, after a battle with teammate Martí. However, Hadjar was spun around by {wikiLink("Gabriel Bortoleto", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Bortoleto")} and collected by {wikiLink("Enzo Fittipaldi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Fittipaldi")} at the first corner of the feature race, ending his race.
    </p>

    <p>
      In {wikiLink("Jeddah", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Jeddah_Formula_2_round")}, Hadjar experienced a woeful weekend as he was forced to retire from the sprint whilst running sixth on the penultimate lap due to an engine issue and retired again on Sunday with another issue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hadjar qualified eighth in {wikiLink("Melbourne", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Melbourne_Formula_2_round")}. At the start of the sprint race, Hadjar wedged his teammate Martí into Bortoleto whilst taking the lead. He then dominated the sprint to win his first race in F2, but was demoted to sixth after being given a 10-second penalty for the incident. In the feature race, Hadjar passed multiple cars following a safety car interruption and held the net race lead thereafter to claim his first victory. After the victory, {wikiLink("Le Parisien", "https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Parisien")} described Hadjar as "Petit {wikiLink("Prost", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Prost")}."
    </p>

    <p>
      Hadjar's impressive qualifying form continued into {wikiLink("Imola", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Imola_Formula_2_round")}, where he qualified third. He was involved in a multi-car collision during the opening lap of the sprint race, which took him out of the running. Despite that, he bounced back by winning his second successive feature event, having taken the lead following a slow pit stop for {wikiLink("Oliver Bearman", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Bearman")} before defending against Bortoleto in the dying laps.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hadjar qualified third in {wikiLink("Monaco", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Monte_Carlo_Formula_2_round")} again, finishing the sprint race in eighth. Another Sunday win looked on the cards as he led after polesitter {wikiLink("Richard Verschoor", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Verschoor")} suffered with car issues, but a late {wikiLink("virtual safety car (VSC)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car#virtual_safety_car_(VSC)")} on the penultimate lap allowed {wikiLink("Zak O'Sullivan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_O%27Sullivan")} to make his mandatory pit stop and come out ahead of Hadjar, who ended up finishing second.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hadjar's good run of form was stopped as he qualified 11th at {wikiLink("Barcelona", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Barcelona_Formula_2_round")}, though he managed to finish sixth and fifth in the races. Hadjar then qualified seventh in {wikiLink("Austria", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Spielberg_Formula_2_round")} after experiencing an engine failure during the session; a subsequent issue with the new engine forced the team to run it with limited power. The problem was rectified before Sunday's race, where Hadjar finished third after a battle with teammate Martí before being passed by {wikiLink("Franco Colapinto", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_Colapinto")} on the last lap.
    </p>

    <p>
      A week later, Hadjar took his first F2 pole for {wikiLink("Silverstone", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Silverstone_Formula_2_round")}. He retired from the sprint after spinning out at Copse corner on lap 8. Despite a slow start, Hadjar bounced back to win the feature race, inheriting victory after {wikiLink("Jak Crawford", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_Crawford")} had been penalised for an unsafe release; this put Hadjar into the lead of the championship.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hadjar qualified third in {wikiLink("Hungary", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Budapest_Formula_2_round")}. In the sprint race, despite starting on the soft tyres, Hadjar managed them well to finish fourth on the road, before being promoted to the rostrum due to a disqualification for original winner Verschoor. However, Hadjar was forced to start from the pit lane on Sunday and he eventually finished 18th. Hadjar qualified third in {wikiLink("Belgium", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Spa-Francorchamps_Formula_2_round")} and finished the shortened sprint in ninth. For the feature race, Hadjar took the lead on lap 8 and held off title rival Bortoleto after their pit stops to take his fourth win of the season, leaving him with a 36-point lead over Bortoleto going into the summer break.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the following round at {wikiLink("Monza", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Monza_Formula_2_round")} yielded no points for Hadjar, despite qualifying on the front row. After finishing tenth in the sprint race, his luck took a turn for the worse when he pitted just before the safety car deployment, causing him to lose positions. In contrast, Bortoleto benefitted from the safety car to win the feature race.
    </p>

    <p>
      He started 20th in both {wikiLink("Baku", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Baku_Formula_2_round")} races after crashing turn 1 during qualifying due to overheating brakes. His low starting position meant Hadjar failed to score points again, causing Bortoleto to pass him in the standings. After a two-month break, Hadjar qualified ninth for the round in {wikiLink("Qatar", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Lusail_Formula_2_round")}, meaning he started second on Saturday. He passed {wikiLink("Oliver Bearman", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Bearman")} on lap 2 of the sprint and built up a three-second lead before his tyres ran out and he was repassed by Bearman on lap 21. Hadjar then spun, dropping to fourth by the flag. In the feature race Hadjar benefitted from a safety car that allowed him to jump up to third place behind title rivals Bortoleto and {wikiLink("Paul Aron", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Aron")}. Bortoleto received a penalty for crossing the pit entry line and Hadjar was promoted to second at the finish, allowing him to reduce Bortoleto's lead to half a point going into the season finale.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hadjar qualified fourth in {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Yas_Island_Formula_2_round")} and finished fifth on Saturday, after suffering front wing damage on the first lap after contact with {wikiLink("Kush Maini", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kush_Maini")}. Though Hadjar was promoted to third on the feature race grid after Aron was forced to start from the pit lane, it would be for naught as Hadjar stalled at the start of the feature race; with Bortoleto finishing second, the Brazilian took the title, condemning Hadjar to finish second overall. On his title loss, Hadjar said "all that hard work for this to happen, I can't believe it, this is the worst moment of my life". Hadjar would end his final F2 season as runner-up in the Drivers' Championship, finishing with four wins, eight podiums, one pole position, one fastest lap, and 192 points compared to teammate Marti's 62.
