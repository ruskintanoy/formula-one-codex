        In {wikiLink("May 2015", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, Ocon was called up by {wikiLink("Force India", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_India")} to drive at the post-race test in {wikiLink("Barcelona", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_Barcelona-Catalunya")}, after {wikiLink("Pascal Wehrlein", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Wehrlein")} was forced to withdraw due to illness. Prior to him claiming the GP3 title, it was announced that Ocon would enter the {wikiLink("Mercedes Junior Team", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Junior_Team")}. In {wikiLink("February 2016", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, it was announced that Ocon would also act as reserve driver for the {wikiLink("Renault Sport F1", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_in_Formula_One")} team for the {wikiLink("2016", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Formula_One_World_Championship")} season.

        Following a twelfth place finish at the {wikiLink("Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}, Ocon recorded twelve consecutive points finishes but was often involved in incidents with teammate {wikiLink("Sergio Pérez", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P%C3%A9rez")}. At the {wikiLink("Canadian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Canadian_Grand_Prix")}, Pérez ignored requests from the team to let Ocon past to challenge {wikiLink("Daniel Ricciardo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo")} for third place. The two drivers collided at the {wikiLink("Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}, forcing Pérez into retirement and giving Ocon a puncture. They made contact again at the {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}, where Ocon was squeezed towards a wall leading up to the Eau Rouge complex. Ocon later remarked that he was "furious" with Pérez and that he "risked [their] lives". Force India team owner {wikiLink("Vijay Mallya", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijay_Mallya")} stated that the repeated incidents were "very concerning" and that he would enforce {wikiLink("team orders", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_orders")} thereon.

      <p>
        Ocon started the {wikiLink("Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Italian_Grand_Prix")} in third place after the {wikiLink("Red Bull", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing")} drivers faced penalties, the highest grid position of his career. He went on to finish the race sixth. He spent much of the {wikiLink("Mexican Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Mexican_Grand_Prix")} in third place and eventually finished fifth. His streak of finishing twenty-seven consecutive races ended at the {wikiLink("Brazilian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Brazilian_Grand_Prix")}, where he collided with {wikiLink("Romain Grosjean", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romain_Grosjean")} on the first lap.

      </p>

      <p>
        At {wikiLink("Racing Point Force India's", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_Point_Force_India")} first race, the {wikiLink("2018 Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}, Ocon achieved the joint-highest starting position of his career with third and went on to finish sixth. Ocon and Pérez collided on the first lap of the {wikiLink("Singapore Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Singapore_Grand_Prix")}, causing Ocon to crash into a wall and end his race. The team described the collision as "unacceptable" and banned the drivers from racing each other. Pérez later apologized for his role in the accident. Ocon was disqualified from eighth place at the {wikiLink("United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_United_States_Grand_Prix")} after his car was found to have exceeded fuel flow limits. At the {wikiLink("Brazilian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Brazilian_Grand_Prix")}, he collided with race leader {wikiLink("Max Verstappen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen")} whilst attempting to un-lap himself, damaging both cars. Both drivers were able to continue racing and Ocon received a ten-second stop-and-go penalty for the incident. They argued just after the race (in which Verstappen finished second) and pushed each other several times. Both drivers were summoned by the {wikiLink("FIA", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA")} and Verstappen was ordered to undertake two days of public service "at the discretion of the FIA" for making deliberate physical contact with Ocon.

        Ocon finished the season twelfth in the {wikiLink("Drivers' Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_World_Drivers%27_Championship")}, scoring 49 points to Pérez's 62.

        Prior to the French Grand Prix, it was announced that Ocon had signed a contract extension with Alpine running to the end of {wikiLink("2024", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Formula_One_World_Championship")}.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ocon started eighth at the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}. Multiple collisions ahead saw him promoted to second place at the first corner, which became first place when race leader {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")} pitted for dry-weather tyres one lap later than the rest of the field. Ocon held on to the lead for the remainder of the race, fending off {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")} to take his and Alpine's maiden Formula One victory. This win was followed by points finishes at the next three races.
      
        The {wikiLink("Turkish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Turkish_Grand_Prix")} took place in damp conditions and Ocon finished tenth having run the entire race distance on one set of intermediate-weather tyres. This was the first time a driver had completed a full race distance without making a pit stop since {wikiLink("1997", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Formula_One_World_Championship")}.
      </p>

      <p>
        A collision with {wikiLink("Antonio Giovinazzi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Giovinazzi")} at the {wikiLink("United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Grand_Prix")} broke Ocon's front wing and ultimately led to retirement. A fifth-place finish at the {wikiLink("Qatar Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Qatar_Grand_Prix")} was followed by a near-podium at the {wikiLink("Saudi Arabian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")}; Ocon briefly led the race at its first restart and ran in third place for most of the race, but was passed by {wikiLink("Valtteri Bottas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas")} shortly before the chequered flag, finishing just 0.102 seconds behind.
     
        Ocon ended the season eleventh in the drivers' championship, scoring 74 points to {wikiLink("Alonso", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso")}'s 81.

        Alpine retained Ocon and Alonso for the {wikiLink("2022", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Formula_One_World_Championship")} season. Ocon finished seventh at the season-opening {wikiLink("Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")} despite receiving a penalty for colliding with {wikiLink("Mick Schumacher", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Schumacher")}. He qualified fifth and finished sixth at the {wikiLink("Saudi Arabian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")} where a close battle with Alonso ended with Ocon being ordered by the team to hold his position. A crash in practice for the {wikiLink("Miami Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Miami_Grand_Prix")} forced him to miss qualifying and start last on the grid. He recovered in the race to finish ninth and was promoted to eighth when Alonso received a penalty. At the {wikiLink("Spanish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Spanish_Grand_Prix")}, Ocon qualified twelfth and finished seventh, ahead of Alonso, after holding off the fast-charging {wikiLink("Lando Norris", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris")}. Ocon finished ninth at the {wikiLink("Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Monaco_Grand_Prix")} but was demoted to twelfth by a penalty for colliding with {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")}.

      <p>
        At the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_British_Grand_Prix")}, he qualified fifteenth with battery issues and retired due to a fuel pump failure. He then scored five consecutive points finishes, including fifth at the {wikiLink("Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Austrian_Grand_Prix")}. He qualified fifth at the {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Belgian_Grand_Prix")} but took an engine penalty, dropping to sixteenth; he recovered to finish seventh.

      <p>
        Brake problems in qualifying for the {wikiLink("Singapore Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Singapore_Grand_Prix")} left him seventeenth on the grid, and he retired with engine failure. His season-best result came at the {wikiLink("Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}, finishing fourth while holding off Hamilton. After a pit lane start at the {wikiLink("United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_Grand_Prix")}, he climbed to eleventh. In the {wikiLink("São Paulo Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix")} sprint, Ocon made contact with Alonso and dropped to seventeenth, but recovered to score points in the main race.

      <p>
        For {wikiLink("2023", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, Ocon gained a new teammate in former karting rival {wikiLink("Pierre Gasly", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gasly")} as Alonso departed to {wikiLink("Aston Martin", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martin_in_Formula_One")}. His training was impacted prior to the start of the season when he got "very sick" with a lung virus.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the season-opening {wikiLink("Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, Ocon received penalties for being out of position on the grid, failing to serve the penalty correctly and for speeding in the pit lane. He eventually retired from the race with mechanical issues. He started sixth and scored his first points of the season at the {wikiLink("Saudi Arabian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")}, finishing eighth. Running in tenth place at the final restart of the {wikiLink("Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, Ocon was involved in a heavy collision with teammate Gasly, who apologised for his role in the incident.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ocon crashed in qualifying at the {wikiLink("Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}. Alpine then made changes to his car under {wikiLink("parc fermé", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_fermé")} conditions, forcing him to start the sprint race and the main race from the pit lane. During the race, Ocon ran on the hard tyres until the last lap. Photographers began to enter the pit lane, not realising Ocon was yet to pit, and narrowly avoided being hit by his car.
      </p>

      <p>
        He started third at the {wikiLink("2023 Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Monaco_Grand_Prix")} after {wikiLink("Charles Leclerc", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc")} ahead received a penalty. Ocon held off Carlos Sainz Jr. in the first half of the race but lost a place to {wikiLink("George Russell", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)")} during the pit stops. A mistake and a penalty for Russell allowed Ocon back into third place, earning him his third career podium and the <i>Driver Of The Day</i> award. More points came at the {wikiLink("2023 Spanish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Spanish_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("2023 Canadian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Canadian_Grand_Prix")} and in the rain-affected {wikiLink("2023 Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Austrian_Grand_Prix")} sprint race where he held off Ferrari's Leclerc and McLaren's Lando Norris. In the main race, Ocon finished outside the points after receiving a penalty for an unsafe pit box release. Post race, he received another four penalties for {wikiLink("track limits", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_limits")} violations, totalling 30 seconds. His five penalties for the Grand Prix gave him the record for the most driving penalties in a single race in the history of Formula One.
     
        Consecutive retirements followed with a hydraulics leak at the {wikiLink("2023 British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_British_Grand_Prix")} and a first-lap crash at the {wikiLink("2023 Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}. He improved from fourteenth on the grid at the {wikiLink("2023 Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Belgian_Grand_Prix")} to score points in eighth place.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ocon retired from the {wikiLink("2023 Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Italian_Grand_Prix")} "for safety reasons" due to a steering issue. He then retired from sixth place at the {wikiLink("2023 Singapore Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Singapore_Grand_Prix")} with a gearbox problem, his fourth non-finish in six races. He finished the {wikiLink("2023 Qatar Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Qatar_Grand_Prix")} in seventh despite the hot weather conditions causing him to vomit into his helmet. His seventh retirement of the season came at the {wikiLink("2023 United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_United_States_Grand_Prix")} after a collision with {wikiLink("Oscar Piastri", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri")}. Ocon started sixteenth at the inaugural {wikiLink("2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Las_Vegas_Grand_Prix")}, avoided collisions to improve to eighth on the first lap and climbed to fourth place by the end of the race.
      
        He ended the season twelfth in the {wikiLink("World Drivers' Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Drivers%27_Championship")} with 58 points, one place and four points behind teammate Gasly.

        Ocon continued alongside {wikiLink("Gasly", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gasly")} at {wikiLink("Alpine", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team")} for {wikiLink("2024", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. During {wikiLink("pre-season testing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Formula_One_pre-season_testing")}, he noted that the team were "on the back foot". The Alpine drivers qualified nineteenth and twentieth for the season-opening {wikiLink("Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, which Gasly described as "not a surprise". The Alpine did not reach the second qualifying session of a Grand Prix until Ocon did so at the third race, the {wikiLink("Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Australian_Grand_Prix")}; however, Ocon still finished sixteenth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ocon claimed the team's first points of 2024 at the {wikiLink("Miami Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Miami_Grand_Prix")}, improving from thirteenth on the grid to tenth at the finish. He qualified eleventh at the {wikiLink("Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Monaco_Grand_Prix")} but retired after colliding with Gasly on track, for which he apologised and claimed responsibility. A week later, Alpine announced Ocon would leave the team at the end of the season. During the {wikiLink("Canadian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Canadian_Grand_Prix")}, Alpine imposed {wikiLink("team orders", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_orders")} forcing Ocon to give up P9 to Gasly, who was in better position to attack {wikiLink("Daniel Ricciardo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo")}. However, after Gasly failed to pass Ricciardo, Alpine did not ask Gasly to give the place back to Ocon, upsetting Ocon. Ocon scored points at the {wikiLink("Spanish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Spanish_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ocon did not score points for the next six races, but {wikiLink("Alpine", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team")} picked up a double podium (its first of the year) at the rain-affected {wikiLink("São Paulo Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix")}, with Ocon finishing second and {wikiLink("Gasly", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gasly")} third. Ocon led the race for a period but was overtaken by eventual winner {wikiLink("Max Verstappen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen")}.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ocon was replaced by {wikiLink("Jack Doohan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Doohan")} for the season-ending {wikiLink("2024 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}. Formula One's website reported Alpine required Ocon to leave the team one race early in exchange for releasing him to {wikiLink("Haas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haas_F1_Team")} for the Abu Dhabi post-season test. In a message on Instagram, Ocon thanked the team and wrote that "this is not how I wanted things to end."
