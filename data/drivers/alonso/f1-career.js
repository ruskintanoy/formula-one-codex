        {wikiLink("Cesare Fiorio", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Fiorio")}, the sports director, gave Alonso a test in a {wikiLink("Formula One", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One")} (F1) car at the {wikiLink("Circuito de Jerez", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuito_de_Jerez")} in December 1999, as part of the Euro Open by Nissan's organising company RPM's agreement to give its series champion an opportunity to test at a higher level. He was {wikiLink("Minardi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minardi")}'s test and reserve driver in {wikiLink("2000", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Formula_One_World_Championship")} before joining its race team in {wikiLink("2001", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. In a non-competitive car, Alonso's best result of the season was a tenth-place finish in the {wikiLink("German Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_German_Grand_Prix")} and scored no {wikiLink("points", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_World_Championship_points_scoring_systems")} for 23rd overall.

      </p>

      <div className="clear-both"></div>

        He went on to break the records of youngest driver to win a pole position at the season's second race, the {wikiLink("Malaysian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Malaysian_Grand_Prix")}, and broke {wikiLink("Bruce McLaren", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_McLaren")}'s record as the youngest F1 race winner at the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")} later in the year.

        Alonso stayed at Renault for {wikiLink("2005", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Formula_One_World_Championship")}.

Alonso's car was more reliable than Räikkönen's albeit lacking in speed. Alonso eclipsed {wikiLink("Emerson Fittipaldi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_Fittipaldi")} as the youngest World Drivers' Champion, having won seven victories, six pole positions and fourteen podium finishes for 133 points altogether.
      </p>

      <p>
        He signed a contract extension with Renault for {wikiLink("2006", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Formula_One_World_Championship")} in April 2005. Bookmakers installed Alonso as the favourite to retain the Drivers' Championship. His primary competition was {wikiLink("Ferrari", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari")} driver {wikiLink("Michael Schumacher", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schumacher")}. Alonso won six of the first nine races and finished no lower than second to lead the championship with 84 out of a possible 90 points.

Alonso won the race as Schumacher retired due to an engine failure whilst leading. He needed to score one point at the season-ending {wikiLink("Brazilian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Brazilian_Grand_Prix")} for a second title. Alonso won the championship by finishing second and was Formula 1's youngest double World Champion.

          He and {wikiLink("McLaren", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren")} team owner {wikiLink("Ron Dennis", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Dennis")} met secretly in Japan after Dennis talked to Alonso about driving for the team in the future and Alonso expressed interest in the idea. Both men agreed to a three-year contract for Alonso to drive for McLaren starting from {wikiLink("2007", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. Alonso's contract with Renault expired on 31 December 2006, and he was not granted an early release for sponsorship reasons. Renault allowed Alonso to make his first appearance for McLaren in a test session at the {wikiLink("Circuito de Jerez", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuito_de_Jerez")} in November 2006.
        </p>

        <p>
          His main competitors in 2007 were his teammate {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")} and {wikiLink("Kimi Räikkönen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimi_R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen")} at Ferrari. Alonso achieved four Grand Prix victories in {wikiLink("Malaysia", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Malaysian_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("Monaco", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("Europe", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_European_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Italy", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Italian_Grand_Prix")} and led the championship until Hamilton overtook him. Prior to the season's final round, the {wikiLink("Brazilian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Brazilian_Grand_Prix")}, he had 103 championship points to Räikkönen's 100 and Hamilton's 107, and needed to win the race and for his teammate to finish third or lower for his third title. Alonso finished the event third for third overall with 109 points. He had the same number of points as Hamilton; the tie was broken on count-back as Hamilton finished second more often than Alonso.

        <p>
          Throughout the season, Alonso and Hamilton were involved in a number of incidents, such as the {wikiLink("espionage scandal", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Formula_One_espionage_controversy")} and the flare-up during qualifying for the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")} when Hamilton disobeyed a team instruction, thus disadvantaging Alonso, and Alonso responded by delaying Hamilton in the pit lane. The tensions culminated in Alonso and McLaren terminating their contract by mutual consent in November. Alonso was forbidden from joining a team whom McLaren considered their primary challengers for {wikiLink("2008", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Formula_One_World_Championship")}.
        </p>

        <p>
          After rejecting offers from several teams, he signed a two-year contract to rejoin Renault from 2008 because of the manufacturer's long-term commitment to F1 and on-track record. Alonso's car lacked power early on due to an imposed moratorium in development and he scored nine points in the first seven races. He was thereafter able to improve his performance later due to aerodynamic developments to the car's and won in {wikiLink("Singapore", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Singapore_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Japan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}; the former race saw Renault order his teammate {wikiLink("Nelson Piquet Jr.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Piquet_Jr.")} to crash deliberately and trigger the deployment of the {wikiLink("safety car", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car")} in what became known as {wikiLink("crashgate", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_Formula_One_crash_controversy")}. Alonso scored more points than any other driver in the final five races with 43. He scored 61 points for fifth in the Drivers' Championship.

After offers from {wikiLink("Red Bull Racing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing")} and {wikiLink("Honda", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_in_Formula_One")}, he re-signed to Renault on a two-year contract. His car proved to be noncompetitive because it lacked a dual diffuser system and outright speed. Alonso eschewed an aerodynamic front wing mandated in an attempt to make overtaking more possible since he did not believe it would help him. He scored points in eight races and achieved one podium finish: a third-place at the {wikiLink("Singapore Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Singapore_Grand_Prix")}.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alonso won pole position for the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")} and led the first 12 laps before he retired following an incorrectly fitted right-front wheel. Alonso was ninth in the Drivers' Championship with 26 points, his lowest placing since he came sixth in 2003; he maintained his reputation as one of F1's best drivers.

          Ahead of {wikiLink("2012", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, Alonso extended his contract with Ferrari until {wikiLink("2016", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. His main competition for the title in 2012 was Vettel. Wins in {wikiLink("Malaysia", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Malaysian_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("Valencia", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_European_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Germany", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_German_Grand_Prix")} and consistent points-scoring finishes allowed him to build a 40-point lead in the Drivers' Championship. Thereafter start-line collisions, a mechanical failure and an improved performance for Vettel eliminated Alonso's points lead.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alonso entered the season-ending {wikiLink("Brazilian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Brazilian_Grand_Prix")} 13 points behind Vettel and needed to finish third and for Vettel not to score points for a third championship. He was second and Vettel finished fourth, despite spinning on the opening lap, resigning Alonso to be runner-up for the second time in his career on 278 points.
        </p>

        <div className="clear-both"></div>

        <p>
          To begin {wikiLink("2013", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, Alonso drove an aggressively designed car allowing him to win in {wikiLink("China", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Chinese_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Spain", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Spanish_Grand_Prix")} and consistently scored points. He was slower than Vettel after a change of tyre compound at the {wikiLink("German Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_German_Grand_Prix")} and front and rear bodywork components intended to improve his car's performance were ineffective. With 242 points, Alonso was second for the third time in his career. His relationship with Ferrari cooled due to his perception the team could not construct a title-winning car.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alonso's 2014 season saw him achieve no race wins because his car was less powerful than the championship-winning {wikiLink("Mercedes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One")} but took third in the {wikiLink("Chinese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Chinese_Grand_Prix")} and second in the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}. Alonso fell to sixth in the Drivers' Championship with 161 points. He qualified faster than his teammate Räikkönen 16 times by an average of more than 1⁄2 second per lap in 2014.

        <div className="clear-both"></div>

        <p>
          Alonso scored points twice in 2015: a tenth in the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_British_Grand_Prix")} and a fifth in the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")} for 17th in the Drivers' Championship with 11 points. He was dissatisfied with a slow pace, which became evident after multiple radio complaints that year.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite the unreliable and noncompetitive car, Alonso remained with McLaren for {wikiLink("2016", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. Injuries from a heavy crash with {wikiLink("Esteban Gutiérrez", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Guti%C3%A9rrez")} at the season-opening {wikiLink("Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Australian_Grand_Prix")} caused him to miss the {wikiLink("Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")} on medical grounds and was replaced by reserve driver {wikiLink("Stoffel Vandoorne", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoffel_Vandoorne")}.

          He qualified better than teammate {wikiLink("Jenson Button", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenson_Button")} fifteen times and scored points nine times, which included two fifth-place finishes in the {wikiLink("Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Monaco_Grand_Prix")} and the {wikiLink("United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_Grand_Prix")}. He was tenth in the Drivers' Championship with 54 points.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alonso stayed at McLaren in {wikiLink("2017", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, but poor reliability affected his season, particularly during the early rounds, and his best finish was a sixth place in the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}. After three consecutive top-ten finishes, Alonso finished 15th in the Drivers' Championship with 17 points.
        </p>

        <div className="clear-both"></div>

        <p>
          Following contract negotiations with the McLaren CEO {wikiLink("Zak Brown", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Brown")}, Alonso signed a multi-year extension with McLaren on 19 October 2017. He finished fifth at the season-opening {wikiLink("2018 Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Australian_Grand_Prix")} and took nine top-ten finishes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alonso out-qualified his teammate Vandoorne at every race and drove quickly and aggressively. He became increasingly annoyed with certain drivers and his commitment to F1 waned after McLaren stopped developing their car to focus on {wikiLink("2019", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. Alonso was 11th in the Drivers' Championship with 50 points, and left the sport as a driver at the end of the 2018 season, citing a perceived lack of on-track racing, the predictability of results and felt discussions away from racing about the broadcast of radio transmissions and polemics harmed the series.
        </p>

        <p>
          He remained at McLaren as a brand ambassador to aid and advise drivers and drove in select test sessions to develop their cars. Alonso drove the {wikiLink("MCL34", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MCL34")} during a two-day in-season post-race Bahrain test in April 2019 to develop tyres for Pirelli. No further runs were planned for him and McLaren focused on their current drivers. Alonso's ambassador contract with McLaren expired at the end of 2019, and was not renewed for 2020.

          Alonso was signed to drive for {wikiLink("Alpine F1 Team", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team")} for the {wikiLink("2021", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Formula_One_World_Championship")} season, alongside {wikiLink("Esteban Ocon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon")}, with Renault having rebranded the team under its new name. In preparation for his F1 return, Alonso performed four testing days driving the {wikiLink("Renault R.S.18", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_R.S.18")} and was quickest in the post-2020 season young driver's test driving the {wikiLink("Renault R.S.20", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_R.S.20")} for Renault.
        </p>

        <p>
          In his first race with Alpine at the {wikiLink("2021 Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, Alonso was forced to retire after plastic debris entered his brake duct. At the {wikiLink("2021 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix")} he finished in 11th after qualifying 15th, with teammate Ocon finishing ahead in tenth, but both were upgraded one position after {wikiLink("Kimi Räikkönen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimi_R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen")} was penalised, giving Alonso his first points of the season.

        <p>
          In {wikiLink("Hungary", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}, Alonso temporarily led the race before he made a pit stop and fell to fourth, ahead of {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")}. Teammate Ocon credited Alonso's defence against Hamilton with enabling him to achieve his first race victory. In August 2021, Alonso invoked an option to extend his contract for the {wikiLink("2022", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Formula_One_World_Championship")} season.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alonso scored points in multiple races following the summer break, finishing sixth in the {wikiLink("Netherlands", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Dutch_Grand_Prix")}, eighth in {wikiLink("Italy", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Italian_Grand_Prix")}, sixth in {wikiLink("Russia", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Russian_Grand_Prix")}, having run in third in Russia before being forced to pit under wet conditions, and third in {wikiLink("Qatar", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Qatar_Grand_Prix")}.

Alonso achieved his highest start driving for Alpine during wet qualifying for the {wikiLink("Canadian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Canadian_Grand_Prix")}, starting in second, but had to endure questionable strategies and an engine issue that developed during the race. He dropped down to seventh, and furthermore, received a post-race time penalty that dropped him down to ninth.

          On his Aston Martin debut at the {wikiLink("2023 Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, Alonso, benefitting from the much-improved machinery of the {wikiLink("Aston Martin AMR23", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martin_AMR23")}, recovered from a first-lap contact with his teammate {wikiLink("Lance Stroll", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Stroll")} without any damage and went on to finish in 3rd place, securing a podium finish and Aston's first since {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")}'s podium at the {wikiLink("2021 Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}. Despite having to serve a penalty due to his car being off-position at the starting grid, he finished in third again at the following race at the {wikiLink("2023 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")}; this marked his 100th podium, making him the sixth driver to have scored 100 podiums in his career. Following the race, he was issued another ten-second penalty due to serving the first one improperly at his pit stop, dropping him to fourth behind {wikiLink("George Russell", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)")}; however, the team's appeal was accepted and the second penalty was reversed, keeping his podium.
