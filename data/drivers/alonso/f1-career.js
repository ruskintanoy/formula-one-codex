        {wikiLink("Cesare Fiorio", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Fiorio")}, the sports director, gave Alonso a test in a {wikiLink("Formula One", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One")} (F1) car at the {wikiLink("Circuito de Jerez", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuito_de_Jerez")} in December 1999, as part of the Euro Open by Nissan's organising company RPM's agreement to give its series champion an opportunity to test at a higher level. He was {wikiLink("Minardi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minardi")}'s test and reserve driver in {wikiLink("2000", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Formula_One_World_Championship")} before joining its race team in {wikiLink("2001", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. In a non-competitive car, Alonso's best result of the season was a tenth-place finish in the {wikiLink("German Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_German_Grand_Prix")} and scored no {wikiLink("points", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_World_Championship_points_scoring_systems")} for 23rd overall.
      </p>

      <p>
        He signed as {wikiLink("Renault", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_in_Formula_One")}'s test driver for {wikiLink("2002", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Formula_One_World_Championship")} per the orders of manager {wikiLink("Flavio Briatore", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavio_Briatore")} to familiarise himself with the team and improve himself for the future. Alonso worked with the engineering department to improve {wikiLink("Giancarlo Fisichella", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giancarlo_Fisichella")}'s and {wikiLink("Jenson Button", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenson_Button")}'s performance, and tested in Spain and the United Kingdom. He drove a {wikiLink("Jaguar", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_Racing")} in an evaluation session against test drivers {wikiLink("André Lotterer", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Lotterer")} and {wikiLink("James Courtney", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Courtney")} at the {wikiLink("Silverstone Circuit", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit")} in May 2002. Alonso was promoted to the Renault race team for {wikiLink("2003", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Formula_One_World_Championship")}.
      </p>

      <p>
        He went on to break the records of youngest driver to win a pole position at the season's second race, the {wikiLink("Malaysian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Malaysian_Grand_Prix")}, and broke {wikiLink("Bruce McLaren", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_McLaren")}'s record as the youngest F1 race winner at the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")} later in the year. He achieved four podium finishes in 2003 and was sixth in the {wikiLink("World Drivers' Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_World_Drivers%27_Champions")} with 55 points.
      </p>

      <p>
        He remained with Renault for {wikiLink("2004", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. Alonso had an improved season: he finished the season-opening {wikiLink("Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Australian_Grand_Prix")} in third position and took three more podium finishes that year. He took pole position for the {wikiLink("French Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_French_Grand_Prix")} but achieved no race victories en route to fourth in the World Drivers' Championship with 59 points.

        Alonso stayed at Renault for {wikiLink("2005", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. He duelled with {wikiLink("McLaren", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren")} driver {wikiLink("Kimi Räikkönen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimi_R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen")} for the World Championship in 2005 due to regulation changes prohibiting teams from changing tyres during a race and requiring engines to last for two races before they could be changed. Alonso's car was more reliable than Räikkönen's albeit lacking in speed. Alonso eclipsed {wikiLink("Emerson Fittipaldi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_Fittipaldi")} as the youngest World Drivers' Champion, having won seven victories, six pole positions and fourteen podium finishes for 133 points altogether.
      </p>

      <p>
        He signed a contract extension with Renault for {wikiLink("2006", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Formula_One_World_Championship")} in April 2005. Bookmakers installed Alonso as the favourite to retain the Drivers' Championship. His primary competition was {wikiLink("Ferrari", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari")} driver {wikiLink("Michael Schumacher", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schumacher")}. Alonso won six of the first nine races and finished no lower than second to lead the championship with 84 out of a possible 90 points.

        An {wikiLink("FIA", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_Internationale_de_l%27Automobile")}-imposed ban on Renault's {wikiLink("tuned mass damper", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuned_mass_damper")} device to slow Alonso and an increase of development into Schumacher's Ferrari for competitiveness saw the two tied on points entering the season's penultimate round, the {wikiLink("Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}. Alonso won the race as Schumacher retired due to an engine failure whilst leading. He needed to score one point at the season-ending {wikiLink("Brazilian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Brazilian_Grand_Prix")} for a second title. Alonso won the championship by finishing second and was Formula 1's youngest double World Champion.
