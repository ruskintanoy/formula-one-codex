        In {wikiLink("April 2019", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Junior_Team")}, {wikiLink("Mercedes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One")} announced that Antonelli had joined their {wikiLink("Junior Team", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Junior_Team")}. On 17–18 April {wikiLink("2024", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, he conducted his first two-day test with the team, driving the {wikiLink("W12", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_W12")} at the {wikiLink("Red Bull Ring", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Ring")}. He completed further private tests in the {wikiLink("W13", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_W13")} at {wikiLink("Imola", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola_Circuit")}, {wikiLink("Silverstone", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit")}, {wikiLink("Barcelona-Catalunya", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_Barcelona-Catalunya")}, and {wikiLink("Spa-Francorchamps", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spa-Francorchamps")}.
      
        Following a regulation change re-allowing drivers to hold an {wikiLink("FIA Super Licence", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA_Super_Licence")} at age 17, Antonelli was rumoured to replace {wikiLink("Logan Sargeant", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant")} at {wikiLink("Williams", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Racing")} during the season. Mercedes denied the move and instead recommended {wikiLink("Mick Schumacher", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Schumacher")} for the seat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Antonelli made his {wikiLink("free practice", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_practice")} debut at the {wikiLink("2024 Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Italian_Grand_Prix")}, taking part in FP1 in {wikiLink("George Russell", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)")}’s {wikiLink("W15", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_W15")}. He set the fastest lap before spinning at {wikiLink("Curva Alboreto", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monza_Circuit")} and colliding with the tyre barrier at 52g. {wikiLink("Toto Wolff", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toto_Wolff")} defended Antonelli after the crash, while journalist {wikiLink("Mark Hughes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hughes_(journalist)")} compared his debut to that of {wikiLink("Tazio Nuvolari", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tazio_Nuvolari")}.
      
        Antonelli next entered FP1 at the {wikiLink("Mexico City Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Mexico_City_Grand_Prix")}, where he placed twelfth before floor damage from debris ended his session. He joined Russell for the {wikiLink("post-season test", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yas_Marina_Circuit")} at {wikiLink("Yas Marina", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yas_Marina_Circuit")}, setting the fifth-fastest time from 62 laps. He completed a further two-day test in the {wikiLink("W11", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-AMG_F1_W11_EQ_Performance")} at {wikiLink("Jerez", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuito_de_Jerez")}.

          Antonelli (pictured at the {wikiLink("Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}) debuted in Formula One with {wikiLink("Mercedes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One")} in {wikiLink("2025", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, aged 18.

        Antonelli signed for {wikiLink("Mercedes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One")} in {wikiLink("2025", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, replacing {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")} to partner {wikiLink("George Russell", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)")} on a one-year contract. With his debut at the {wikiLink("Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, he became the {wikiLink("first Italian driver", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_drivers_from_Italy")} in Formula One since {wikiLink("Antonio Giovinazzi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Giovinazzi")} in {wikiLink("2021", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}, and the {wikiLink("third-youngest driver", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_driver_records#Youngest_drivers_to_start_a_race")} in Formula One history at 18 years and 203 days old. 
        He qualified sixteenth with floor damage before climbing to fourth in the rain-affected Grand Prix, making several on-track overtakes and an opportune {wikiLink("pit stop", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop")} for {wikiLink("intermediate tyres", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_tyres")} to become the {wikiLink("second-youngest points-scorer", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_driver_records#Youngest_drivers_to_score_points")} in Formula One history and the highest-placed debutant since {wikiLink("2014", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Australian_Grand_Prix")}.
      </p>

      <p>
        After finishing seventh on his {wikiLink("sprint", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_racing#Sprint")} debut in {wikiLink("China", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Chinese_Grand_Prix")}, he clinched sixth in the main race after both {wikiLink("Ferrari", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari")} drivers were disqualified, despite sustaining further floor damage due to debris. He qualified and finished sixth in {wikiLink("Japan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}, becoming the youngest driver {wikiLink("to lead a race", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_driver_records#Led_for_at_least_one_lap,_youngest_leaders")} and {wikiLink("to set a fastest lap", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_driver_records#Youngest_drivers_to_set_a_fastest_lap")} in Formula One history. 
        Antonelli also became the third driver to achieve three consecutive top-six finishes from debut, after {wikiLink("Jackie Stewart", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Stewart")} and {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")}.
      </p>

      <p>
        He qualified fourth for the {wikiLink("Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, but was demoted to fifth with a grid penalty for a team error. He ultimately dropped outside the points on a three-stop strategy, finishing eleventh.
