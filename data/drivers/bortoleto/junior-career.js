        Bortoleto began {wikiLink("karting", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karting")} in October 2011. He started competing in the Campeonato Sulbrasileiro de Kart in 2012. Aged 11, he moved to Europe to pursue a racing career with support from his family. He remained in karts until 2019, with his most successful year being 2018, where he finished third in the {wikiLink("European", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIK-FIA_Karting_European_Championship")} and {wikiLink("World Championships", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karting_World_Championship")} in the {wikiLink("OK-Junior", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK-Junior")} category, and became vice-champion in both the {wikiLink("WSK Super Master Series", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSK_Super_Master_Series")} and the Andrea Margutti Trophy.

His first podium came at {wikiLink("Mugello", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mugello_Circuit")}, where he scored second, third, and a victory, taking his first single-seater win in the fourth round of the season. He scored two more podiums in {wikiLink("Monza", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodromo_Nazionale_di_Monza")} and finished the season fifth in the overall championship, ahead of Montoya but behind Beganovic and eventual champion Minì. Bortoleto also finished fourth in the rookies' standings.

        In March 2021, it was announced that Bortoleto would be making his debut in the {wikiLink("Formula Regional European Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Formula_Regional_European_Championship")} with {wikiLink("FA Racing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso")}, run by {wikiLink("MP Motorsport", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP_Motorsport")}. He scored his first points in the first race of the season in Imola, where he finished ninth. From there it took until the seventh round at the {wikiLink("Red Bull Ring", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Ring")} for Bortoleto to score again — this time claiming a podium in the second race. This began a run of top ten finishes, resulting in 15th place in the standings at the end of the year.

      <p>
        In his first race at the{" "}
        {wikiLink("Bahrain International Circuit", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain_International_Circuit")}, Bortoleto was penalised for causing a collision with{" "}

        He scored points consistently in the next five rounds, including second place in the feature at the{" "}

Though he fell down to fourth at the start of Sunday's event, Bortoleto moved back to second after the pit stop phase; he chased down Hadjar but could not pass him before the race ended, claiming his first podium in F2 with second place. He then qualified ninth in{" "}
        {wikiLink("Monaco", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Monte_Carlo_Formula_2_round")} and finished the sprint race in second, having started from the front row due to the reverse-top-ten format. He then finished the feature in eighth. More points followed in both{" "}
        {wikiLink("Barcelona", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Barcelona_Formula_2_round")} races, though Bortoleto was demoted from seventh to tenth in the feature after causing a collision with his teammate on the final lap.

      <p>
        In {wikiLink("Austria", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Spielberg_Formula_2_round")} Bortoleto qualified fourth and progressed from eighth to fourth during the sprint race, though he narrowly lost out on a podium to{" "}
        {wikiLink("Paul Aron", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Aron")}. On Sunday, Bortoleto passed race leader{" "}
        {wikiLink("Joshua Dürksen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_D%C3%BCrksen")} on lap 4 and later overtook Martí, who had jumped him by pitting during a virtual safety car, to claim his maiden F2 victory and enter the top three in the championship. He progressed further with two points results at{" "}
        {wikiLink("Silverstone", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Silverstone_Formula_2_round")} but was penalised again due to a battle with Maini, this time being demoted from third to fourth after a last-lap overtake was judged to have happened off-track. In the{" "}
        {wikiLink("Budapest", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Budapest_Formula_2_round")} sprint race Bortoleto struggled with tyre wear on his soft tyres, dropping to 16th, and finished fourth in the feature race after losing the podium to{" "}
        {wikiLink("Richard Verschoor", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Verschoor")} on the final lap. For the final round before the summer break in{" "}
        {wikiLink("Belgium", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Spa-Francorchamps_Formula_2_round")} Bortoleto qualified second and fought for the victory with Hadjar, eventually ending up second and moving up to said place in the standings after a late technical issue ended Aron's race.

        Bortoleto's start to the{" "}
        {wikiLink("Monza", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Monza_Formula_2_round")} round was a disaster: he spun in qualifying before setting a time, therefore necessitating a start from last place for both races. In the sprint race, Bortoleto charged through to eighth, sharing the final point with{" "}
        {wikiLink("Dennis Hauger", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hauger")} after crossing the finish line in a{" "}
        {wikiLink("dead heat", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_heat")}. It would however be the feature race where Bortoleto experienced his standout result of the entire year: he benefited from an opportune safety car, which, following his pit stop, allowed him to stay ahead of all drivers who had stopped prior to its deployment. Bortoleto drove out a gap to take a last-to-first victory and benefited from Hadjar's scoreless weekend to close up in the championship. He became the first driver to win from last on the grid in Formula 2. This performance later earned him the{" "}
        {wikiLink("Mecachrome", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecachrome")} Outstanding Win Award at the end-of-year prize giving ceremony.

      <p>
        In the{" "}
        {wikiLink("Baku", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Baku_Formula_2_round")} round, Bortoleto finished the sprint race in fifth place and the main race in fourth, taking the lead in the drivers' championship by 4.5 points over Hadjar. Bortoleto qualified second in{" "}
        {wikiLink("Qatar", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Lusail_Formula_2_round")} and finished fifth on Saturday. He then took the lead from Aron at the start of the feature race, only to be penalised for crossing the pit entry line behind the pit bollard when avoiding the pit lane entrance during a virtual safety car deployment. Though he progressed through the pack and crossed the line in first, Bortoleto was demoted behind Aron and Hadjar in the results, meaning that he and Hadjar would go into the season finale with a gap of half a point.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bortoleto qualified second again on{" "}
        {wikiLink("Yas Island", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Yas_Island_Formula_2_round")}. A charge from ninth to second in the sprint allowed him to enter the final race with a four-point advantage, as Hadjar finished fifth. The start of the feature race decided the championship fight, as Hadjar stalled on the grid. Bortoleto meanwhile took the lead from{" "}
        {wikiLink("Victor Martins", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Martins")} at turn one and although he was later overtaken by Dürksen following the pit stop phase, Bortoleto finished second and was crowned Formula 2 champion.
