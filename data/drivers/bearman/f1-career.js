        In October 2021, Bearman was named as one of the finalists of the {wikiLink("Ferrari Driver Academy", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_Driver_Academy")}'s Scouting World Final. The following month, Bearman was confirmed to be joining the academy along with karting champion {wikiLink("Rafael Câmara", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_C%C3%A2mara")}.
      </p>

      <p>
        In October 2023, Bearman made his first test in a {wikiLink("Formula One car", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_car")} during a private session at {wikiLink("Fiorano", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiorano_Circuit")} with Ferrari. He made his {wikiLink("free practice", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_racing#Free_practice")} debut at the {wikiLink("2023 Mexico City Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Mexico_City_Grand_Prix")} with {wikiLink("Haas F1 Team", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haas_F1_Team")}. He finished 15th, and was only three tenths off Haas driver {wikiLink("Nico Hülkenberg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_H%C3%BClkenberg")}. Haas stated they were "very impressed" with his performance. He took part in his second free practice at the {wikiLink("2023 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}. Bearman then drove the {wikiLink("Haas VF-23", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haas_VF-23")} in the young drivers' test.
      </p>

      <p>
        On 27 January 2024, Bearman was announced as Ferrari's reserve driver for the {wikiLink("2024", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Formula_One_World_Championship")} season, sharing the role with {wikiLink("Robert Shwartzman", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Shwartzman")} and {wikiLink("Antonio Giovinazzi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Giovinazzi")}. He was also later confirmed as a reserve driver for Haas, and drove the {wikiLink("Haas VF-24", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haas_VF-24")} during first practice at the {wikiLink("2024 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix")} in place of {wikiLink("Kevin Magnussen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen")}. He drove the VF-24 again during the {wikiLink("Pirelli", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirelli")} tyre test at {wikiLink("Silverstone Circuit", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit")}. Bearman drove the {wikiLink("Ferrari SF-24", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_SF-24")} during first practice at the {wikiLink("2024 Mexico City Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Mexico_City_Grand_Prix")}, but his running ended prematurely following a collision with {wikiLink("Alex Albon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Albon")}.

        Bearman made his Formula One debut at the{" "}
        {wikiLink("2024 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")},
        replacing{" "}
        {wikiLink("Carlos Sainz Jr.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr.")} after he withdrew from the event with{" "}
        {wikiLink("appendicitis", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendicitis")} following the second free practice session,
        becoming the youngest-ever driver to compete for{" "}
        {wikiLink("Ferrari", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari")}. Bearman qualified eleventh, missing out on Q3 by 36 hundredths.
        In the race, Bearman was able to hold off{" "}
        {wikiLink("Lando Norris", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris")} and{" "}
        {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")} in the closing stages of the race to secure seventh place and his maiden points finish; he became the{" "}
        {wikiLink("then-youngest driver to score points on debut", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_driver_records#Youngest_drivers_to_start_a_race")} in Formula One. Additionally, he was voted{" "}
        <i>Driver of the Day</i> by the fans and received widespread acclaim from drivers and critics for his performance on short notice.{" "}
        {wikiLink("Charles Leclerc", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc")} also stated that it was "a matter of time before we see [him] permanently in the Formula 1 paddock".
        Bearman was put on standby for the{" "}
        {wikiLink("2024 Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, but ultimately Sainz was fit enough to drive.
      </p>

      <p>
        Between Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan, he took part in four practice sessions for Haas as young/reserve driver.
      </p>

      <p>
        In July, {wikiLink("Haas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haas_F1_Team")} announced that Bearman had signed a multi-year contract with the team from{" "}
        {wikiLink("2025 Formula One World Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Formula_One_World_Championship")} onwards, following months of speculation. Bearman made an early debut for Haas at the{" "}
        {wikiLink("2024 Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}, after{" "}
        {wikiLink("Kevin Magnussen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen")} received a race ban. He narrowly missed out on a Q3 appearance once again, as he qualified eleventh but ahead of teammate{" "}
        {wikiLink("Nico Hülkenberg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_H%C3%BClkenberg")}. In the race, Bearman finished tenth, beating Hülkenberg in both sessions to score another points finish and become the first driver in history to score points for two different teams in his first two races.
        Bearman would again deputise for Magnussen at the{" "}
        {wikiLink("2024 São Paulo Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix")}, after Magnussen withdrew due to illness. He beat Hülkenberg in both sprint sessions, where he qualified tenth and finished fourteenth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bearman was involved in several incidents in the wet-weather conditions during the Grand Prix—including a 10-second time penalty for causing a collision with{" "}
        {wikiLink("Franco Colapinto", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_Colapinto")} and a high-speed spin, he qualified sixteenth and finished twelfth.
