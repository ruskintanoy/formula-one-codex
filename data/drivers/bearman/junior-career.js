      </p>

      <p>
        Bearman started his season by controlling the first race of the year in{" "}
        {wikiLink("Bahrain", "URL_TO_BAHRAIN_F3")} — although, having crossed the finish line in first place, he was issued a penalty for multiple track limits breaches, which demoted him to second behind{" "}
        {wikiLink("Isack Hadjar", "URL_TO_ISACK_HADJAR")}.
        He followed it up with a strong sixth place in the feature race.
      
        This was followed by a disappointing event at{" "}
        {wikiLink("Imola", "URL_TO_IMOLA_F3")}; there, having been denied a points finish in the first race due to a spin that had come as a direct result of teammate Leclerc pushing him onto the grass,
        Bearman was battling to remain in third place near the end of Sunday's feature race. On the final lap, Bearman collided with{" "}
        {wikiLink("Grégoire Saucy", "URL_TO_GREGOIRE_SAUCY")} at the penultimate corner, which sent the Swiss driver out of the race and caused Bearman to be demoted from fourth to 17th post-race.
      
        The next round in {wikiLink("Barcelona", "URL_TO_BARCELONA_F3")} panned out more quietly, scoring a fifth place during the feature race.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bearman gained form in the subsequent three rounds, starting from{" "}
        {wikiLink("Silverstone", "URL_TO_SILVERSTONE_F3")}, where from sixth, Bearman made a penultimate lap pass on{" "}
        {wikiLink("Caio Collet", "URL_TO_CAIO_COLLET")} for the rostrum places before battling his compatriot{" "}
        {wikiLink("Zak O'Sullivan", "URL_TO_ZAK_OSULLIVAN")} to the line for second; nevertheless, it was Bearman's first feature race podium.
      
        Bearman then qualified third in{" "}
        {wikiLink("Austria", "URL_TO_AUSTRIA_F3")}. He lost a few places after a slight contact with{" "}
        {wikiLink("Zane Maloney", "URL_TO_ZANE_MALONEY")} mid-race, but eventually finished in sixth place, only to be dropped to 16th due to track limits.
        In a damp feature race, Bearman remained in his position to secure another third place podium.
      
        Bearman qualified third in{" "}
        {wikiLink("Hungary", "URL_TO_HUNGARY_F3")} for the second successive round. After finishing fifth in the sprint race, Bearman secured yet another third place during the feature race, as he narrowly missed out on pipping Maloney for second by 0.025s.
      </p>

      <p>
        Following the summer break in{" "}
        {wikiLink("Spa-Francorchamps", "URL_TO_SPA_FRANCORCHAMPS_F3")}, Bearman was able to fight his way to the front during the opening embers of the sprint race, having started from fifth, and took his first victory in the category despite a pair of{" "}
        {wikiLink("Safety car", "URL_TO_SAFETY_CAR")} and a Red flag interruption interfering with his race. The following day, Bearman once again finished third in the feature race, having overtaken{" "}
        {wikiLink("Oliver Goethe", "URL_TO_OLIVER_GOETHE")} on the final lap.
      
        Misfortune followed in{" "}
        {wikiLink("Zandvoort", "URL_TO_ZANDVOORT_F3")}, as a red flag hampered Bearman's qualifying efforts, leaving the Brit 14th on the grid. In the sprint race, Bearman moved up to tenth, but made a mistake and lost the position to{" "}
        {wikiLink("Roman Staněk", "URL_TO_ROMAN_STANEK")}, finishing in 11th. During the feature race, a penalty for a collision with O'Sullivan meant that Bearman lost his tenth place again, not adding points to his tally.
      
        Undeterred by his slim title chances going into the season finale at{" "}
        {wikiLink("Monza", "URL_TO_MONZA_F3")}, Bearman would qualify in sixth. In the sprint race, Bearman finished second courtesy of a double-overtake on{" "}
        {wikiLink("Jonny Edgar", "URL_TO_JONNY_EDGAR")} and{" "}
        {wikiLink("Caio Collet", "URL_TO_CAIO_COLLET")} into the first chicane, and even almost snatched the win from{" "}
        {wikiLink("Franco Colapinto", "URL_TO_FRANCO_COLAPINTO")} on the last lap.
      
        He continued his fight on Sunday, battling for the lead with{" "}
        {wikiLink("Zane Maloney", "URL_TO_ZANE_MALONEY")} before a red flag ended the race prematurely, meaning Bearman finished the race in second place. With one win, eight podiums, and 132 points, Bearman finished third in the standings, a mere seven points behind champion{" "}
        {wikiLink("Victor Martins", "URL_TO_VICTOR_MARTINS")}.
      
        Despite being regretful of "all the races where [he] needlessly lost points", the Briton maintained that he was happy to finish third in the championship.

      <p>
        On 14 November 2022, Bearman was announced as a{" "}
        {wikiLink("Prema Racing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prema_Powerteam")} driver for the{" "}
        {wikiLink("2023 Formula 2 Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Formula_2_Championship")},
        partnering {wikiLink("Mercedes junior", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Junior_Team")}{" "}
        {wikiLink("Frederik Vesti", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederik_Vesti")}.
     
        Bearman started his season in{" "}
        {wikiLink("Bahrain", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Sakhir_Formula_2_round")} with 12th in qualifying, but could not salvage much in the sprint race, finishing P15. Taking advantage of lap 1 chaos in the feature race, Bearman rose to fourth early on. However, tyre degradation proved to be a factor as he was among the first to pit, and fell down the order late on for a disappointing 14th place.
 
        In{" "}
        {wikiLink("Jeddah", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Jeddah_Formula_2_round")}, the Briton broke his duck and qualified second having topped practice. However, his sprint race ended after{" "}
        {wikiLink("Théo Pourchaire", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9o_Pourchaire")} braked late and slammed into him, which ended both their races.
    
        In the feature race, Bearman battled with{" "}
        {wikiLink("Victor Martins", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Martins")} early on after seizing the lead at the start. However Bearman spun on his own later on, which dropped him down the order, and he subsequently lost more positions, ultimately finishing in tenth place.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bearman ended sixth in qualifying at{" "}
        {wikiLink("Melbourne", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Melbourne_Formula_2_round")}, despite an early crash. In a sprint race where he battled many of his rivals, he secured seventh. However, in the feature race, Bearman's race came undone when he tangled with{" "}
        {wikiLink("Isack Hadjar", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isack_Hadjar")} in the pits, sustaining a puncture. He had to pit again and had a trip to the gravel later on, finishing 17th.
      
        Bearman claimed his maiden pole position the next round in{" "}
        {wikiLink("Baku", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Baku_Formula_2_round")} in dramatic circumstances, managing to set the fastest lap despite a shunt just minutes before the end of the session resulted in his steering wheel pointing slightly to the right. Starting the race ninth after a grid penalty for Pourchaire, Bearman came through the field to move up to fourth by lap 1.
      
        In the closing stages, leaders{" "}
        {wikiLink("Dennis Hauger", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hauger")},{" "}
        {wikiLink("Victor Martins", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Martins")}, and{" "}
        {wikiLink("Jehan Daruvala", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehan_Daruvala")} crashed out in turn 1 following a late safety car restart. After navigating around the pileup, Bearman capitalised on a mistake by teammate Vesti to take the lead before the race was neutralised once more, becoming the second youngest race winner in Formula 2.
   
        The following day, in the feature race, Bearman claimed victory and became the ninth driver in GP2 and Formula 2 history to do "the double" and only the fourth as a rookie.
      </p>

      <p>
      The next round in{" "}
      {wikiLink("Monaco", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Monte_Carlo_Formula_2_round")} proved to be disappointing as Bearman retired on lap 23 of the sprint race due to a suspension problem; in the feature race, he finished just outside the points owing to a poor qualifying in 11th. Despite that, he retained his good form by scoring his second pole in{" "}
      {wikiLink("Barcelona", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Barcelona_Formula_2_round")}.
      
        A good start in a wet sprint race meant Bearman would finish in seventh place. In the feature race, he fended off{" "}
        {wikiLink("Enzo Fittipaldi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Fittipaldi")} at the start, and from there, he controlled the race to secure his third win.
      
        He qualified a disappointing 19th for{" "}
        {wikiLink("Austria", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Spielberg_Formula_2_round")}. In the sprint race, despite pitting for slick tyres, Bearman was able to finish in eighth and score a point after a comeback. A timely pit stop during the safety car allowed Bearman to make up a heap of places, and he eventually improved to fifth place after numerous overtakes on fresh tyres.
     
        In{" "}
        {wikiLink("Silverstone", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Silverstone_Formula_2_round")}, Bearman qualified fifth and moved up to second briefly in the sprint. However, his race slowly unravelled as he spun, before making his way back to sixth after a mistake into the gravel trap amidst a battle with{" "}
        {wikiLink("Jack Doohan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Doohan_(racing_driver)")}.
      
        A strong start saw him up to third, but contact later on with{" "}
        {wikiLink("Kush Maini", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kush_Maini")} meant Bearman was given a five-second penalty, demoting him from sixth to eighth in the feature race.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bearman qualified seventh in{" "}
        {wikiLink("Hungary", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Budapest_Formula_2_round")}. He finished in third place after a late lunge on Pourchaire in the dying laps meant he moved up to the rostrum places. However, he lacked pace in the feature race, as he faded down to 13th place.
      
        Bearman secured his third pole of the season in{" "}
        {wikiLink("Spa-Francorchamps", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Spa-Francorchamps_Formula_2_round")}. In the feature race, he lost the lead in the pit stops to Pourchaire, and he eventually finished in fourth at the chequered flag, but contact with{" "}
        {wikiLink("Victor Martins", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Martins")} earned Bearman a penalty, which dropped him to seventh place.
      
        Starting sixth for the feature race in{" "}
        {wikiLink("Zandvoort", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Zandvoort_Formula_2_round")}, Bearman spun at the start after being hit by{" "}
        {wikiLink("Juan Manuel Correa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Manuel_Correa")}, but he made his way back up the order, only for his race to end prematurely due to a collision with Martins, which broke Bearman's suspension.
      
        Bearman proceeded to qualify on the front row at{" "}
        {wikiLink("Monza", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Monza_Formula_2_round")}. Despite being shuffled outside the top 10 during the sprint race start, Bearman was able to gain places and finish in sixth position. In the feature race, Bearman managed to pass polesitter Pourchaire at the start, and from there, he controlled the race for his fourth win, placing him within one point of Martins for fifth in the standings.
      </p>

      <p>
        He qualified in a disappointing 17th for the{" "}
        {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi season finale", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Yas_Island_Formula_2_round")}. He finished the sprint in tenth, but an engine failure on lap 20 curtailed his race prematurely. Despite this, Bearman ended his season sixth in the drivers' championship with 130 points, securing four wins, five podiums, two pole positions, and two fastest laps. He also helped Prema secure second in the teams' championship.

      <p>
        Bearman remained with {wikiLink("Prema Racing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prema_Racing")} for the {wikiLink("2024 season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Formula_2_Championship")}, paired up with {wikiLink("Mercedes junior", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Junior_Team")} and {wikiLink("2023 FRECA champion", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Formula_Regional_European_Championship")} {wikiLink("Andrea Kimi Antonelli", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Kimi_Antonelli")}.
    
        Prema struggled to adapt to the {wikiLink("new regulations", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallara_F2_2024")} at the start of the season, as Bearman came away without points in the {wikiLink("Bahrain opener", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Sakhir_Formula_2_round")} owing to qualifying down in 18th. Despite his struggles, Bearman qualified on pole for the next round in {wikiLink("Jeddah", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Jeddah_Formula_2_round")}.
     
        However, he withdrew from the event to replace {wikiLink("Carlos Sainz", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr")} at {wikiLink("Ferrari", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari")} for the {wikiLink("Saudi Arabian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")}. Bearman returned in {wikiLink("Melbourne", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Melbourne_Formula_2_round")}, but a technical issue in qualifying limited him to only 16th.
    
        He was set to score his first points in the sprint race with eighth, but received a penalty for forcing {wikiLink("Joshua Dürksen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_D%C3%BCrksen")} wide, dropping him to 14th. In the feature race, despite being held in a double-stack pit stop under the {wikiLink("safety car", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car")}, Bearman finished ninth, scoring his first points.
     
        Bearman then qualified second at {wikiLink("Imola", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Imola_Formula_2_round")}, finishing the sprint in fifth place as he took advantage of a first-lap multi-car accident to move up the order. During the feature race, Bearman took the lead on the opening lap but stalled during his mandatory pit stop, condemning him to 19th at the chequered flag.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bearman qualified 15th in {wikiLink("Monte Carlo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Monte_Carlo_Formula_2_round")}. In the feature race, a bold strategy call for an early stop meant Bearman finished fourth, his best finish of the season at that point.
     
        A torrid weekend followed in {wikiLink("Barcelona", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Barcelona_Formula_2_round")}, where he finished the sprint 21st due to track limits penalties, and finished the feature race 14th, where {wikiLink("Valentin Khorounzhiy", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentin_Khorounzhiy")} of <i>The Race</i> described his weekend as "truly turgid, amid balance struggles manifesting what the team described as <i>strong understeer</i> - which then also seemingly translated into the tyres getting absolutely shredded over longer runs".
      
        Bearman finally broke his duck in {wikiLink("Austria", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Spielberg_Formula_2_round")} by winning the sprint race from second, where he held off {wikiLink("Pepe Martí", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Mart%C3%AD")} for his first victory. Speaking about his win, Bearman admitted it was "painful" to not be fighting for the championship. His feature race, however, was a complete contrast, as he retired on lap 21 with an engine issue.
      
        Bearman qualified fifth for {wikiLink("Silverstone", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Silverstone_Formula_2_round")}. In the sprint race, he damaged his front wing on the opening lap following contact with {wikiLink("Gabriel Bortoleto", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Bortoleto")}, before retiring on lap 15 from another engine issue. In the feature race, he briefly moved to second after a good start, but eventually fell to seventh.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bearman failed to score points in {wikiLink("Hungary", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Budapest_Formula_2_round")} once again after a poor qualifying.
      
        More woes followed for Bearman in {wikiLink("Spa-Francorchamps", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Spa-Francorchamps_Formula_2_round")}, as during the feature race, Bearman crashed out on the opening lap after a collision with {wikiLink("Zane Maloney", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zane_Maloney")} and Martí, and he was given a five-place grid drop for the next round. In {wikiLink("Monza", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Monza_Formula_2_round")}, Bearman won the sprint race from eighth on the grid as he slowly made his way up the order for a second triumph. After improving to second at the start of the feature race, he duelled with teammate {wikiLink("Antonelli", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Kimi_Antonelli")} and eventually finished seventh, his first double points finish of the season.
      
        Bearman missed the next round in {wikiLink("Baku", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Baku_Formula_2_round")} to replace a banned {wikiLink("Kevin Magnussen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen")} at {wikiLink("Haas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haas_F1_Team")} for the {wikiLink("Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}.
      
        Bearman qualified on reverse pole in {wikiLink("Qatar", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Lusail_Formula_2_round")}. Despite being passed by {wikiLink("Isack Hadjar", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isack_Hadjar")} early in the sprint race, Bearman eventually re-passed him to secure his third win of the year. The feature race did not go as planned as an early safety car dashed Bearman's hopes on the alternate strategy, and he eventually placed down in 12th place. He qualified 15th for the season finale in {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Yas_Island_Formula_2_round")}.
     
        Bearman made good comebacks during the races, finishing in fourth during the sprint and fifth in the feature. Bearman finished his season a disappointing 12th in the driver's standings with 75 points despite being considered as a title favourite going into the season. On his season, Bearman said, "It was tough to not be fighting for wins regularly, but I will have seasons like this in my career and it has been a great learning experience." During the season, he took three wins and one fastest lap.
