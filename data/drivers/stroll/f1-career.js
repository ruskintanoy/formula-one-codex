        Stroll drove for the {wikiLink("Williams", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Grand_Prix_Engineering")} team for the {wikiLink("2017 Formula One season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Formula_One_season")}, partnering {wikiLink("Felipe Massa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Massa")}. He became the first {wikiLink("Canadian Formula One driver", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Formula_One_driver")} since the {wikiLink("1997", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Formula_One_World_Championship")} World Drivers' Champion {wikiLink("Jacques Villeneuve", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Villeneuve")}. Reportedly, Stroll's father {wikiLink("Lawrence Stroll", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Stroll")} paid $80 million to Williams prior to his Formula One debut.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stroll crashed in practice for his debut race, the {wikiLink("2017 Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, and received a grid penalty as this necessitated an unscheduled gearbox change. He retired from the race with a brake failure. Two more retirements followed after collisions with {wikiLink("Sergio Pérez", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P%C3%A9rez")} at the {wikiLink("2017 Chinese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Chinese_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Carlos Sainz Jr.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr.")} at the {wikiLink("2017 Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}. Stroll's first race finish came at the {wikiLink("2017 Russian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Russian_Grand_Prix")}, where he finished in eleventh despite spinning on the first lap. He retired with a brake failure at the {wikiLink("2017 Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}, but was still classified fifteenth. Stroll scored his first Formula One points at his {wikiLink("home Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Canadian_Grand_Prix")} in Montreal, finishing in ninth place.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the {wikiLink("Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}, Stroll had run in second place in the closing laps, but was passed by {wikiLink("Valtteri Bottas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas")} just metres from the finish line. He finished third to become the youngest rookie and the second-youngest driver after {wikiLink("Max Verstappen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen")} to finish on the podium in Formula One, at the age of 18 years and 239 days, becoming the {wikiLink("second-youngest driver to score a podium finish", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_driver_records#Youngest_drivers_to_score_a_podium_finish")} and the youngest to do so during their rookie season.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stroll registered the fourth fastest time during a wet qualifying session for the {wikiLink("Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Italian_Grand_Prix")}. Due to Red Bull drivers {wikiLink("Daniel Ricciardo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo")} and {wikiLink("Max Verstappen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen")} taking grid penalties, Stroll was promoted to second place on the starting grid, making him the youngest Formula One driver to start on the front row at the age of 18 years and 310 days. Stroll finished seventh in the race. He recorded two eighth-place finishes at the {wikiLink("Singapore Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Singapore_Grand_Prix")} (where he started eighteenth) and {wikiLink("Malaysian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Malaysian_Grand_Prix")}. At the latter, Stroll and {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")} collided on the cool-down lap after the end of the race. Both drivers blamed the other for the incident, however no action was taken by the stewards.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the {wikiLink("Mexican Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Mexican_Grand_Prix")}, Stroll worked his way up to sixth place in the race from eleventh on the grid. Stroll ended the season twelfth in the standings, one place below teammate Massa who had both outqualified and outraced Stroll 17–2 and 9–4 (in races both drivers finished) respectively. Furthermore, Stroll gained more positions on the opening lap than any other driver that year.

      <p>
        For the {wikiLink("2018 season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Formula_One_Season")}, Stroll remained with {wikiLink("Williams", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_FW41")}, partnered by {wikiLink("Sergey Sirotkin", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Sirotkin_(racing_driver)")} after Massa retired from Formula One. The {wikiLink("Williams FW41", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_FW41")} was the slowest car of the field and the team finished last in the constructors' championship that season. Stroll scored the team's first points of the year at the {wikiLink("Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")} by finishing eighth. Stroll's home race, the {wikiLink("Canadian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Canadian_Grand_Prix")}, ended on the first lap after a heavy collision with {wikiLink("Brendon Hartley", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendon_Hartley")}. He then retired from the following {wikiLink("French Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_French_Grand_Prix")} with a tire puncture. His second and final retirement of the year came at the {wikiLink("German Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_German_Grand_Prix")} with a brake failure. Stroll made his only appearance in the third qualifying session (Q3) at the {wikiLink("Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Italian_Grand_Prix")}, qualifying tenth. He went on to finish ninth in the race with teammate Sirotkin in tenth, marking Williams' only double points-finish that season.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stroll finished eighteenth in the Drivers' Championship, scoring six of the team's seven points. Sirotkin out-qualified Stroll at twelve of the twenty-one races.

        Stroll switched to driving for the newly renamed {wikiLink("Racing Point", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_Point")} team for the {wikiLink("2019", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Formula_One_World_Championship")} season after the team was bought by a consortium of investors led by his father {wikiLink("Lawrence Stroll", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Stroll")}. He replaced {wikiLink("Esteban Ocon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon")} and raced alongside {wikiLink("Sergio Pérez", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P%C3%A9rez")}. Stroll scored his first points for the team at the season-opening {wikiLink("Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, finishing ninth. At the {wikiLink("Chinese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Chinese_Grand_Prix")}, he criticised team strategy after finishing outside of the points for the second consecutive race. At the {wikiLink("Spanish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Spanish_Grand_Prix")}, he was involved in a collision with {wikiLink("Lando Norris", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris")}, ending both drivers' races. He finished ninth at the {wikiLink("Canadian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Canadian_Grand_Prix")} from seventeenth on the grid.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the {wikiLink("German Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_German_Grand_Prix")}, Stroll progressed past Q1 in qualifying—ending a streak of fourteen consecutive Q1 eliminations—and switched to slick tyres late in the race as the track dried, briefly elevating him to second. He was ultimately passed by {wikiLink("Daniil Kvyat", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Kvyat")} and {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")}, finishing fourth. He next scored points at the {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Belgian_Grand_Prix")} in tenth, and again at the {wikiLink("Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Japanese_Grand_Prix")} in ninth. Stroll retired from the final two races of the season—suffering a suspension failure in {wikiLink("Brazil", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Brazilian_Grand_Prix")} and brake issues in {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}.
      </p>

      <p>
        He ended his first season at Racing Point fifteenth in the {wikiLink("Drivers' Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Drivers%27_Championship")} with 21 points, compared to teammate Pérez’s 52. He was outqualified by Pérez in eighteen of the twenty-one races.

        Stroll and {wikiLink("Pérez", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P%C3%A9rez")} were retained by {wikiLink("Racing Point", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_Point")} for {wikiLink("2020", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. As a result of Canada's national sporting authority resigning its mandate from the {wikiLink("FIA", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA")}, Stroll raced under an American licence but was still recognised as Canadian on race weekends. At the {wikiLink("Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Austrian_Grand_Prix")}, he qualified in ninth but retired with engine problems. His first points came at the {wikiLink("Styrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Styrian_Grand_Prix")}, finishing seventh after overtaking {wikiLink("Daniel Ricciardo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo")} in a move the latter called "desperate".
      </p>

      <p>
        Stroll qualified third and finished fourth at the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}, followed by four more points finishes including another fourth at the {wikiLink("Spanish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Spanish_Grand_Prix")}. He claimed his second career podium at the {wikiLink("Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Italian_Grand_Prix")}, finishing third after briefly running second during a red flag restart. Stroll admitted his poor restart likely cost him a chance at victory.
      </p>

      <p>
        After eight races, Stroll was fourth in the Drivers' Championship. A sequence of retirements began with a heavy crash at the {wikiLink("Tuscan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Tuscan_Grand_Prix")} due to mechanical failure. He was eliminated on the first lap of the {wikiLink("Russian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Russian_Grand_Prix")} after contact with {wikiLink("Charles Leclerc", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc")}. He withdrew from the {wikiLink("Eifel Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Eifel_Grand_Prix")} due to illness—later testing positive for COVID-19—and missed qualifying, being replaced by {wikiLink("Nico Hülkenberg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_H%C3%BClkenberg")}.
      </p>

      <p>
        He returned at the {wikiLink("Portuguese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Portuguese_Grand_Prix")}, where he collided with {wikiLink("Lando Norris", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris")} and retired. At the {wikiLink("Turkish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Turkish_Grand_Prix")}, he took his maiden {wikiLink("pole position", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_polesitters")}, becoming the first Canadian to do so since {wikiLink("Jacques Villeneuve", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Villeneuve")} in 1997. He led 32 laps but fell to ninth due to tyre graining, later attributed to front wing damage.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the {wikiLink("Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, Stroll’s car flipped following contact with {wikiLink("Daniil Kvyat", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Kvyat")}, though he escaped unscathed. He scored his third career podium with third place at the {wikiLink("Sakhir Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Sakhir_Grand_Prix")} after capitalizing on Mercedes' tyre issues.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stroll finished eleventh in the Drivers’ Championship with 75 points, contributing to Racing Point’s 210-point total.

A video of him driving over a {wikiLink("curb", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curb")} at the {wikiLink("Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Monaco_Grand_Prix")} became a popular {wikiLink("internet meme", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme")}, used as a bait-and-switch similar to {wikiLink("rickrolling", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling")}, after the official broadcast interrupted a battle between Vettel, {wikiLink("Pierre Gasly", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gasly")} and {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")} to show a replay of Stroll. A high-speed tyre failure at the {wikiLink("Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")} ended Stroll's race, prompting {wikiLink("Pirelli", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirelli")} to launch an investigation following a similar incident involving {wikiLink("Max Verstappen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen")}. He scored a point with tenth at the {wikiLink("French Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_French_Grand_Prix")}, recovering from nineteenth after being unable to set a qualifying lap.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stroll caused a first-lap collision at the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")} that eliminated both himself and {wikiLink("Charles Leclerc", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc")}, while damaging {wikiLink("Daniel Ricciardo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo")}'s car. He received a five-place grid penalty for the {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}. Stroll later achieved seventh at the {wikiLink("Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Italian_Grand_Prix")}, his best result at that point, but collided with both Vettel and Gasly at the {wikiLink("Russian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Russian_Grand_Prix")}, earning a ten-second penalty. He crashed in qualifying at the {wikiLink("Mexico City Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Mexico_City_Grand_Prix")} and finished fourteenth. His best result of the season came at the {wikiLink("Qatar Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Qatar_Grand_Prix")}, finishing sixth. Stroll ended the season thirteenth in the World Drivers' Championship, scoring 34 points to Vettel's 43.

        Stroll remained with {wikiLink("Aston Martin", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martin_in_Formula_One")} for {wikiLink("2023", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, partnered with {wikiLink("Fernando Alonso", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso")} who replaced the retiring {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")}. Stroll missed all three days of pre-season testing at {wikiLink("Bahrain International Circuit", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain_International_Circuit")} after suffering a cycling accident while training. He sustained multiple injuries in the accident including fractures in both wrists and a broken toe. Minor surgery was performed on his right wrist with metal screws being inserted. He was replaced by reserve driver {wikiLink("Felipe Drugovich", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Drugovich")} for the test, but returned for the season-opening {wikiLink("2023 Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}. In the second free practice session, he reported lingering pain from his wrists that forced him to adopt a relaxed style of driving; he said that while he felt "rather stiff", he "felt alright" in the car. Stroll qualified eighth for the race and finished sixth despite a first-lap collision with teammate Alonso. He started fifth at the {wikiLink("2023 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")} but retired from the race with engine issues. He finished fourth at the {wikiLink("2023 Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, his best result of the year, despite first-lap contact with {wikiLink("Charles Leclerc", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc")} and later running into the gravel at the second restart.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stroll scored points in the sprint and main race at the {wikiLink("Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}, but failed to score at the {wikiLink("Miami Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Miami_Grand_Prix")} after being eliminated in Q1. Damage from an accident caused his retirement from the following {wikiLink("Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}. He scored points at the next three races, including finishing ninth from sixteenth at the start in the {wikiLink("Canadian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Canadian_Grand_Prix")}, and fourth place at the {wikiLink("Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Austrian_Grand_Prix")} sprint. He finished eleventh at the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_British_Grand_Prix")} but was demoted by a penalty for colliding with {wikiLink("Pierre Gasly", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gasly")}.

He finished outside the top ten at the {wikiLink("Dutch Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Dutch_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Italian_Grand_Prix")}; his practice running at {wikiLink("Monza", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monza_Circuit")} was curtailed by a fuel system failure and he then qualified in last place. A heavy crash in qualifying at the {wikiLink("Singapore Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Singapore_Grand_Prix")} caused his withdrawal from the weekend, with Aston Martin team principal {wikiLink("Mike Krack", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Krack")} stating that Stroll was "still feeling the after-effects" of the accident.

        After qualifying seventeenth at the {wikiLink("Qatar Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Qatar_Grand_Prix")}, 1.1 seconds behind teammate Alonso's time, Stroll appeared to push his personal trainer in frustration as he exited the vehicle. He finished ninth in the race but was demoted outside the points positions with a track limits penalty. He started from the pit lane at the {wikiLink("United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_United_States_Grand_Prix")} but recovered to finish the race ninth; he was later promoted to seventh after the disqualifications of {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")} and {wikiLink("Charles Leclerc", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc")} and scored his first points in six races. Stroll started from the pit lane again at the {wikiLink("Mexico City Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Mexico_City_Grand_Prix")} and retired with damage from a collision with {wikiLink("Valtteri Bottas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas")}. He achieved his best qualifying result since 2020 at the {wikiLink("São Paulo Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix")} with third place, ahead of Alonso, and finished fifth. He gained nine places from his starting position at the {wikiLink("Las Vegas Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Las_Vegas_Grand_Prix")} to again finish fifth. Stroll ended the season tenth in the {wikiLink("Drivers' Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_World_Championship")}, the highest ranking in his Formula One career. He scored 74 points to Alonso's 206 and was outqualified by Alonso at nineteen of the season's twenty-two races. Team principal Krack defended Stroll's performance relative to Alonso, stating that despite the points difference, "there [was] not a marked gap in performance" between the two and confirmed that Stroll would remain with the team alongside Alonso for {wikiLink("2024", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Formula_One_World_Championship")}.

        Stroll started the 2024 season with a tenth-place finish at the {wikiLink("Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}. He then qualified tenth at the {wikiLink("Saudi Arabian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")}, but crashed out on lap 7 after hitting the wall at turn 23. He bounced back in {wikiLink("Australia", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, qualifying ninth and finishing sixth. Following the weekend, it was announced that Stroll's race engineer Ben Michell would be replaced by Andrew Vizard.

      <p>
        For the first sprint weekend of the season in {wikiLink("China", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Chinese_Grand_Prix")}, Stroll qualified 15th for the sprint and finished the shorter race 14th. He then qualified 11th for the main race, but the main race was a disaster as Stroll finished 15th after being given a 10-second penalty for crashing into the back of {wikiLink("Daniel Ricciardo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo")} on lap 26 following a safety car restart. After the race Ricciardo was furious with Stroll saying "I watched his onboard and he's not even looking at me, he's looking at the apex, I don't know why he's not looking at the car in front."
      </p>

      <p>
        Stroll then qualified 7th for the sprint in {wikiLink("Miami", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Miami_Grand_Prix")} but retired on lap 1 due to teammate Alonso sliding into him after a collision between his teammate and {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")}. He qualified 11th for the main race but finished 17th after a penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage. Stroll then qualified 13th at the {wikiLink("Emilia Romagna Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix")} but finished in 9th scoring his first points since Australia.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stroll then qualified 13th for the {wikiLink("Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Monaco_Grand_Prix")} but finished 14th after throwing his chance for points away when he got a puncture after hitting the wall in the middle of the race. Stroll bounced back with a seventh-place finish at his home race in {wikiLink("Canada", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Canadian_Grand_Prix")}, and achieved further points in {wikiLink("Britain", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_British_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Hungary", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}. However, this would end up being Stroll's last points result of the season, one which he finished 13th overall. Of note was an error-strewn weekend in {wikiLink("Brazil", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix")}, where Stroll crashed during the qualifying session, lost his car under braking on the formation lap, and beached his car in the gravel while trying to recover back to the track.
