      {wikiLink("Jeddah", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Jeddah_Formula_2_round")} and would start the sprint race in the same position. After race leader{" "}
      {wikiLink("Dennis Hauger", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hauger")} made an error going through the pitlane during the safety car, Lawson was promoted to the podium places. As soon as the safety car was withdrawn, Lawson quickly overtook{" "}
      {wikiLink("Calan Williams", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calan_Williams")} and later{" "}
      {wikiLink("Jake Hughes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Hughes")} to take his first win of the season and second overall.

      Lawson had a below par qualifying in{" "}
      {wikiLink("Imola", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Imola_Formula_2_round")}, qualifying only 14th. He made a great start, moving up to tenth. He then overtook{" "}
      {wikiLink("Ayumu Iwasa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayumu_Iwasa")} and then gained a position following Boschung's retirement, stealing a point in eighth. In the feature race, Lawson was set for more points, until the safety car was brought out on lap 6, which destroyed his pit strategy as he started on hards. Running in 13th after his pit stop, his steering wheel broke, slamming him into the wall and ending his race, in what was to be a frustrating weekend. Lawson once again qualified poorly, this time even lower in 16th. He had an electric start in the sprint race, but missed points in ninth. Lawson had another good feature race start, making up seven positions at the start. After the round of pit stops, Lawson sat sixth, but with drivers behind on fresher tyres, fell to ninth at the flag.
