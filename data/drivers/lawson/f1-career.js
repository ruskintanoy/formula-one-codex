      <p>
        In February 2019, Lawson joined the {wikiLink("Red Bull Junior Team", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Junior_Team")}. He got his first experience in an F1 car at the 2021 {wikiLink("Goodwood Festival of Speed", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwood_Festival_of_Speed")}, driving the 2011 {wikiLink("Red Bull RB7", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_RB7")}.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lawson participated in the Young Driver Test at {wikiLink("Yas Marina Circuit", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yas_Marina_Circuit")} with {wikiLink("Scuderia AlphaTauri", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_AlphaTauri")} at the end of the {wikiLink("2021 season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. For 2022, he served as reserve/test driver for AlphaTauri and made his free practice debut at the {wikiLink("2022 Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}.

      <p>
        Lawson made his Formula One debut at the {wikiLink("2023 Dutch Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Dutch_Grand_Prix")} for AlphaTauri, temporarily replacing the injured Ricciardo. Despite qualifying 20th with limited practice, he finished 13th while battling {wikiLink("Charles Leclerc", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc")} and outperforming teammate {wikiLink("Yuki Tsunoda", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Tsunoda")}.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the {wikiLink("2023 Singapore Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Singapore_Grand_Prix")}, Lawson qualified a career-best tenth (knocking out {wikiLink("Max Verstappen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen")} in Q2) and finished ninth - scoring his first F1 points and becoming the first New Zealander to score since {wikiLink("Brendon Hartley", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendon_Hartley")} in 2018.
      </p>

      <p>
        After further races in Italy, Japan, and Qatar, Lawson returned to his reserve role when Ricciardo recovered for the {wikiLink("United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_United_States_Grand_Prix")}.

      <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-red-400 mb-1">2024: Late-season stint</h4>

      <p>
        Lawson continued his role as reserve driver for {wikiLink("Red Bull Racing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing")} and {wikiLink("RB Formula One Team", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Formula_One_Team")} (the rebranded AlphaTauri) in {wikiLink("2024", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. Lawson completed a filming day with the {wikiLink("Red Bull RB20", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_RB20")} in mid-July at {wikiLink("Silverstone", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit")}, following the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_British_Grand_Prix")}. At the end of July, he completed another day of testing for RB with the 2022 {wikiLink("AlphaTauri AT03", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaTauri_AT03")} at {wikiLink("Imola", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola_Circuit")}. Due to poor performances by Ricciardo in the early parts of the season, rumors speculated that Lawson could replace him mid-season, but Ricciardo denied later in the season that manager {wikiLink("Helmut Marko", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Marko")} had threatened to do so.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ricciardo was dropped by RB after the {wikiLink("Singapore Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Singapore_Grand_Prix")}, with Lawson replacing him for the remaining six rounds of the season. At the {wikiLink("United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_Grand_Prix")}, Lawson started 19th due to engine penalties. Starting on the hard tyre, Lawson went long and was able to jump teammate Tsunoda during the pit stops. His efforts yielded him ninth place, which received praise from {wikiLink("Christian Horner", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner")}.
      </p>

      <div className="clear-both"></div>

      <p>
        Lawson qualified for the {wikiLink("Mexico City Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Mexico_City_Grand_Prix")} in 12th. He had a contentious battle in the race with Red Bull driver {wikiLink("Sergio Pérez", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P%C3%A9rez")}, and made contact with him, causing Lawson to raise his middle finger at him after passing him a few laps later. He ultimately finished one place ahead of Pérez in 16th, and later apologised as he admitted that it was "not something that [I] should have done".
      </p>

      <p>
        After narrowly missing out on points in his first sprint at the {wikiLink("São Paulo Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix")}, Lawson produced his best qualifying result to date in a rain-hit session, securing fifth on the grid, two places behind Tsunoda. In the race, although he was spun by {wikiLink("Oscar Piastri", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri")} on lap 26, Lawson was able to withstand the treacherous conditions and finish in ninth place.

      <p>
        At the {wikiLink("Las Vegas Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Las_Vegas_Grand_Prix")}, starting 14th, Lawson attempted a one-stop strategy, but a long second stint left him pitting late and he eventually finished 16th. Lawson had a miserable {wikiLink("Qatar Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Qatar_Grand_Prix")}, colliding with {wikiLink("Valtteri Bottas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas")} in the opening laps which earned him a ten-second penalty. Attaining floor damage from the contact, he was left to finish in 13th place. At the {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}, Lawson had another troubled race when his front left wheel was not fitted correctly during his pit stop, forcing him to pit again. A mechanical issue later forced him out of the race with three laps remaining. Lawson finished the season 21st in the standings, collecting four points across the six Grand Prix he competed in.

At the season-opening {wikiLink("2025 Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, he qualified eighteenth before crashing out of the race in changing conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lawson qualified last for both the sprint and main race in {wikiLink("China", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Chinese_Grand_Prix")}, finishing fourteenth at the former and twelfth at the latter following three disqualifications—and a penalty for {wikiLink("Jack Doohan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Doohan")}—ahead of him; Red Bull opened discussions to replace him with {wikiLink("Yuki Tsunoda", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Tsunoda")} after his performances in the opening two rounds.
