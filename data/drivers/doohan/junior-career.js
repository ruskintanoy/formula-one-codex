      </p>

      <p>
        The next winter he returned to the {wikiLink("series", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_F3_Asian_Championship")} with Pinnacle Motorsport. He once again finished in the runner-up spot, this time behind {wikiLink("Joey Alders", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Alders")}.

      <p>
        In 2020 Doohan progressed to the {wikiLink("FIA Formula 3 Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_FIA_Formula_3_Championship")}, driving for {wikiLink("HWA Racelab", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HWA_Racelab")}, partnering {wikiLink("Jake Hughes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Hughes")} and {wikiLink("FDA-member", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_Driver_Academy")} {wikiLink("Enzo Fittipaldi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Fittipaldi")}. Doohan's high point during the season was seventh in qualifying in {wikiLink("Silverstone", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_2nd_Silverstone_Formula_3_round")} and topping practice in {wikiLink("Spa-Francorchamps", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Spa-Francorchamps_Formula_3_round")}, but mainly his campaign was full of incidents and misfortune. Doohan did not score any points during the campaign, and with a best finish of eleventh place, which came at the final race in {wikiLink("Mugello", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Mugello_Formula_3_round")}, he classified 26th in the drivers' championship. Despite describing the year as having been "very very tough", Doohan maintained that he had been able to learn more from it than he would have from a more successful season. He tested for {wikiLink("Trident", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_Racing")} during post-season testing.
      </p>

      {/* 2021 */}
      <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-red-400 mb-1">2021</h4>

      <p>
        For the {wikiLink("2021 season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_FIA_Formula_3_Championship")} Doohan made the switch to {wikiLink("Trident", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_Racing")} to partner {wikiLink("Clément Novalak", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cl%C3%A9ment_Novalak")} and {wikiLink("David Schumacher", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Schumacher_(racing_driver)")}. He started strong with second in qualifying at {wikiLink("Barcelona", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Barcelona_Formula_3_round")}, scored points with eighth in Sprint Race 2, and took second in the feature. In {wikiLink("France", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Le_Castellet_Formula_3_round")} he placed eighth and fifth in the sprints and won after overtaking {wikiLink("Dennis Hauger", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hauger")}. At the {wikiLink("Red Bull Ring", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Spielberg_Formula_3_round")}, he was promoted to third in Sprint 1, but suffered a puncture in the feature.
      </p>

      <p>
        Doohan claimed third in the {wikiLink("Budapest", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Budapest_Formula_3_round")} feature after a mixed sprint showing. Then came his standout weekend at {wikiLink("Spa-Francorchamps", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Spa-Francorchamps_Formula_3_round")} — pole by 0.7s, 12th in Sprint 1, but wins in both Sprint 2 and the feature, becoming the first {wikiLink("FIA Formula 3", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA_Formula_3_Championship")} driver to win twice in one weekend. He had solid results at {wikiLink("Zandvoort", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Zandvoort_Formula_3_round")} and took pole for the {wikiLink("final round in Sochi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Sochi_Formula_3_round")}. A mistake in the sprint gave Hauger the title, but Doohan defied team orders to win the feature and seal the teams' title for Trident.

      <p>
        Doohan remained in F3 post-season with {wikiLink("Van Amersfoort Racing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Amersfoort_Racing")}.

      <p>
        Doohan joined {wikiLink("MP Motorsport", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP_Motorsport")} for the final two rounds of the {wikiLink("2021 championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_FIA_Formula_2_Championship")}, replacing {wikiLink("Richard Verschoor", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Verschoor")}. He qualified 16th in {wikiLink("Jeddah", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Jeddah_Formula_2_round")} and nearly snatched reverse pole. In only his second race, he placed fifth. Doohan then qualified P2 at the {wikiLink("Yas Marina finale", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Yas_Island_Formula_2_round")} and finished eighth in Sprint 2. His feature ended with a lap-one crash. He wrapped up the season 19th overall with eight points.

His start to the season looked promising, scoring pole position in the season opener at {wikiLink("Bahrain", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Sakhir_Formula_2_round")}. Doohan lacked pace in the sprint race and ended where he started. A collision with {wikiLink("Théo Pourchaire", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9o_Pourchaire")} at the pit exit broke his front wing in the feature, dropping him to last before recovering to tenth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Doohan qualified third in {wikiLink("Jeddah", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Jeddah_Formula_2_round")}, but was disqualified due to a technical infringement. He collided with {wikiLink("Logan Sargeant", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant")} during the sprint, earning a grid drop. He finished ninth in the feature. Another tough round came at {wikiLink("Imola", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Imola_Formula_2_round")}, where he clashed with {wikiLink("Dennis Hauger", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hauger")} after qualifying third. But he bounced back with pole in {wikiLink("Barcelona", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Barcelona_Formula_2_round")}, scored sixth in the sprint, and second in the feature behind {wikiLink("Felipe Drugovich", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Drugovich")}.
      </p>

      <p>
        Doohan qualified fifth in {wikiLink("Monaco", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Monte_Carlo_Formula_2_round")}, promoted to third. After finishing seventh in the sprint, he placed fourth in the feature, narrowly missing the podium. In {wikiLink("Baku", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Baku_Formula_2_round")}, he qualified 11th, suffered a collision in the sprint, and received a penalty in the feature for contact with {wikiLink("Liam Lawson", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Lawson")} that dropped him to 13th.
     
        Doohan qualified seventh at {wikiLink("Silverstone", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Silverstone_Formula_2_round")}, and won his first race of the season in wet conditions in the sprint. He added ninth in the feature. His form continued with a podium at the {wikiLink("Red Bull Ring", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Spielberg_Formula_2_round")}, but he finished 19th in the feature after gambling on wet tyres. At {wikiLink("Paul Ricard", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Le_Castellet_Formula_2_round")}, he qualified fourth, finished fourth in the sprint, and slipped to fifth in the feature after a spin while overtaking.
    
        In {wikiLink("Budapest", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Budapest_Formula_2_round")}, Doohan won the sprint from reverse pole, but a gearbox failure ended his feature race on the opening lap.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the summer break, Doohan experienced an exceptional round at {wikiLink("Spa-Francorchamps", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_Spa-Francorchamps")}, firstly qualifying fourth. He finished second in the sprint race after a good start, even passing {wikiLink("Ralph Boschung", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Boschung")} on the last lap. After jumping to second in the start, Doohan undercut race leader {wikiLink("Felipe Drugovich", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Drugovich")} during the pit stops and claimed his first F2 feature race victory. Doohan qualified in second the next week at {wikiLink("Zandvoort", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Zandvoort_Formula_2_round")}, and finished ninth in the sprint. However, a collision with {wikiLink("Richard Verschoor", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Verschoor")} on a safety car restart forced his retirement.

      <p>
        He scored his third pole of the year at {wikiLink("Monza", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Monza_Formula_2_round")}, finished sixth in the sprint, but had another forgetful feature race after a bad start and a collision with {wikiLink("Jehan Daruvala", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehan_Daruvala")}. At the season finale in {wikiLink("Yas Marina", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Yas_Island_Formula_2_round")}, he finished seventh in the sprint, but a loose wheel forced his retirement in the feature. Doohan finished sixth in the standings with 128 points, three wins, three poles, four fastest laps, and six podiums.

      <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-red-400 mb-1">2023</h4>

      <p>
        Doohan participated in the 2022 post-season test with {wikiLink("Virtuosi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuosi_Racing")}, and was confirmed to continue with the team for the {wikiLink("2023 Formula 2 Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Formula_2_Championship")} alongside {wikiLink("Amaury Cordeel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaury_Cordeel")}.

      <p>
        Doohan had a terrible {wikiLink("opening round in Bahrain", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Sakhir_Formula_2_round")}, qualifying 17th and scoring no points. He bounced back in {wikiLink("Jeddah", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Jeddah_Formula_2_round")}, qualifying fourth and scoring his first points with seventh in the sprint, then second in the feature after capitalizing on others' mistakes. In his {wikiLink("home race in Melbourne", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Melbourne_Formula_2_round")}, he qualified 15th after topping practice. He was spun by {wikiLink("Juan Manuel Correa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Manuel_Correa")} in the sprint but recovered to finish eighth in the feature.
      
        Doohan endured another rough weekend at {wikiLink("Baku", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Baku_Formula_2_round")}, with an incident in the sprint and 16th in the feature, ending the weekend point-less once again.
      </p>

      <p>
        In {wikiLink("Monaco", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Monte_Carlo_Formula_2_round")}, Doohan qualified in fourth and his sprint race was rather uneventful, ending in sixth place. In the feature race, he was running in fourth and set for a big haul of points until he crashed mid-race at Massenet corner.{" "}
        {wikiLink("Barcelona", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Barcelona_Formula_2_round")} saw Doohan back in the top 3 for qualifying. He would claim fifth place in the sprint race, but fell back in the feature race for sixth place. In {wikiLink("Austria", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Silverstone_Formula_2_round")}, Doohan qualified in fifth. A trip through the gravel ruined his chances of a good result, though he would fight back to seventh place. In the feature race, Doohan improved his place during the start to third, later passing{" "}
        {wikiLink("Théo Pourchaire", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9o_Pourchaire")} and was set for second place until a late safety car, where alternate strategy runners{" "}

        {wikiLink("Ayumu Iwasa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayumu_Iwasa")} passed him, dropping to fourth place. In{" "}
        {wikiLink("Silverstone", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Silverstone_Formula_2_round")}, Doohan secured fourth in qualifying. During the sprint race, he charged up the order whilst having a tense battle with{" "}
        {wikiLink("Oliver Bearman", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Bearman")}. The Australian won out the fight, claiming third and his first podium since the second round. He had a solid feature race, finishing fourth during a hectic race.
      </p>

      <p>
        In {wikiLink("Hungary", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Budapest_Formula_2_round")}, Doohan made his mark by securing his first pole of the year. During the feature race, Doohan would go on to dominate the race, taking his maiden win of the season by nine seconds. In{" "}
        {wikiLink("Spa-Francorchamps", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Spa-Francorchamps_Formula_2_round")}, Doohan would continue his form by topping practice, but qualified in a disappointing 11th. Doohan improved to fifth in the sprint race. During the feature race, Doohan ran the alternate strategy and luck would go his way when the safety car was deployed late on. He pitted and emerged in second place, in which he overcame leader Pourchaire on the second last lap for consecutive feature race victories.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aiming to continue his stunning run of form, he qualified fifth in{" "}
        {wikiLink("Zandvoort", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Zandvoort_Formula_2_round")}. However, he failed to score any points, even failing to complete a lap in the feature race after spinning on a damp track. A messy qualifying in{" "}
        {wikiLink("Monza", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Monza_Formula_2_round")} saw Doohan only 14th, and numerous safety cars in the feature race limited him to only sixth place, knocking himself out of title contention. Doohan took pole position for the final race in{" "}
        {wikiLink("Yas Marina", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Yas_Island_Formula_2_round")}. During the sprint race he gained four places to finish sixth. In the feature race he had a good start from pole position leading until he pitted on lap 10 for the medium tyres. He then controlled the race and won by 3.8 seconds which allowed him to jump{" "}
        {wikiLink("Ayumu Iwasa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayumu_Iwasa")} for third place in the standings, securing three wins, five podiums, two pole positions and two fastest laps. Doohan exited Formula 2 at the end of 2023 in a bid to join{" "}
