        In September 2017 Doohan was signed to the {wikiLink("Red Bull Junior Team", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Junior_Team")}. He left the academy following his 2021 season and signed to the {wikiLink("Alpine Academy", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_Academy")} in 2022. Doohan described his switch as being a "no-brainer", stating that the F1 testing programme and the team's project within the {wikiLink("World Endurance Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIA_World_Endurance_Championship")} gave him myriad opportunities for the future. He would get his first chance to test the {wikiLink("Alpine A521", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_A521")} at the {wikiLink("Losail International Circuit", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Losail_International_Circuit")} in May of that year. He then drove the car again at the {wikiLink("Monza Circuit", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monza_Circuit")} prior to the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_British_Grand_Prix")} weekend.
      </p>

      <p>
        In September, Doohan tested with the {wikiLink("Alpine F1 Team", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team")} {wikiLink("A521", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_A521")} at the {wikiLink("Hungaroring", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungaroring")}, alongside {wikiLink("Antonio Giovinazzi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Giovinazzi")} and {wikiLink("Nyck de Vries", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyck_de_Vries")}. Doohan participated in his first {wikiLink("free practice sessions (FP1)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One#Free_practice")} with Alpine at the {wikiLink("Mexico City Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Mexico_City_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}. He was even in discussions of a {wikiLink("2023 Formula One", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Formula_One_World_Championship")} seat with the French outfit, but it was handed to {wikiLink("Pierre Gasly", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gasly")}. Doohan also took part in the post-season tests with the Alpine.

      <p>
        In 2023, Doohan was announced as the reserve driver for Alpine. Doohan partook in his first F1 test of the year in May, driving the A521 at {wikiLink("Monza", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monza_Circuit")}. Doohan again participated in the first free practice with Alpine at the {wikiLink("Mexico City Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Mexico_City_Grand_Prix")}. He completed 25 laps and ranked 18th overall. He drove again in Free Practice 1 for the {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")} with Alpine, setting the thirteenth-fastest time as the fourth-ranked rookie. He then took part in the young drivers' test once again with Alpine, setting the seventh fastest time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Doohan focused his 2024 campaign on being the reserve driver for Alpine, where he revealed his goal to join the Formula One grid for the {wikiLink("2025 season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. In May 2024, Doohan completed his first test of the year with the {wikiLink("Alpine A522", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_A522")} at {wikiLink("Zandvoort", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_Zandvoort")}. He partook in the first free practice session for Alpine at the {wikiLink("Canadian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Canadian_Grand_Prix")}, as well as the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_British_Grand_Prix")}. Doohan again drove the A522 at {wikiLink("Circuit Paul Ricard", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_Paul_Ricard")} as he was marked as one of the contenders for a seat with Alpine for 2025 in place of the departing {wikiLink("Esteban Ocon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon")}.

          Doohan (pictured at the {wikiLink("Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}) made his full-time debut with Alpine in {wikiLink("2025", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Formula_One_World_Championship")}.

        Doohan partnered {wikiLink("Pierre Gasly", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gasly")} for {wikiLink("2025", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, his first full-time campaign in Formula One. Amidst rumours he could be replaced by the newly-recruited reserve driver {wikiLink("Franco Colapinto", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_Colapinto")} early into the season, his manager and Alpine team adviser {wikiLink("Flavio Briatore", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavio_Briatore")} stated "if there's a driver who isn't bringing me results, [I will] change him" and Doohan commented "you're always going to have pressure on your shoulders [in] such a cut-throat sport".
      </p>

      <p>
        He qualified fourteenth at the season-opening {wikiLink("Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, before crashing on the opening lap in wet conditions. He received 10-second time penalties in both the sprint and main races in {wikiLink("China", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Chinese_Grand_Prix")} as he finished twentieth and thirteenth, respectively; he caused a collision with {wikiLink("Gabriel Bortoleto", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Bortoleto")} at the former and forced {wikiLink("Isack Hadjar", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isack_Hadjar")} off-track at the latter. In the second {wikiLink("free practice", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_practice")} session at the {wikiLink("Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}, he failed to close his {wikiLink("drag reduction system", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_reduction_system")} into the flat-out {wikiLink("First Turn", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuka_International_Racing_Course")}, causing him to spin into the barriers at 160 mph (260 km/h); he qualified nineteenth and finished fifteenth.
