      Renault / Alpine test driver (2020–2022)
    </h3>

    <p>
      Piastri joined the {wikiLink("Renault Sport Academy", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_Sport_Academy")} in January 2020. After winning the {wikiLink("FIA Formula 3 Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_FIA_Formula_3_Championship")} in 2020, he took part in his first Formula One test in October with the {wikiLink("Renault F1 Team", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_F1_Team")}, driving the {wikiLink("Renault R.S.18", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_R.S.18")} at {wikiLink("Bahrain International Circuit", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain_International_Circuit")} alongside fellow academy drivers {wikiLink("Christian Lundgaard", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Lundgaard")} and {wikiLink("Zhou Guanyu", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Guanyu")}.
    </p>

    <p>
      He remained part of the now-rebranded {wikiLink("Alpine Academy", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team")} in 2021 and drove the {wikiLink("Alpine A521", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_A521")} in the post-season young drivers' test at {wikiLink("Yas Marina Circuit", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yas_Marina_Circuit")} in December.
    </p>

    <p>
      After his Formula 2 title victory, Piastri was appointed as {wikiLink("Alpine F1 Team", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team")}'s reserve driver for the {wikiLink("2022 season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. He was also made available as a reserve driver for {wikiLink("McLaren", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren")} following an agreement between the two teams. He took part in Alpine's testing sessions in the A521 throughout the season, including at the {wikiLink("Circuit of the Americas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_of_the_Americas")}, {wikiLink("Losail International Circuit", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Losail_International_Circuit")} and {wikiLink("Silverstone Circuit", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit")}.
    </p>

    <p>
      {wikiLink("McLaren", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren")} team principal {wikiLink("Andreas Seidl", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Seidl")} later confirmed that Piastri had a private two-day testing session in a previous-spec McLaren car at {wikiLink("Circuit Paul Ricard", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_Paul_Ricard")} the week before the {wikiLink("São Paulo Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix")}.

      2022 Contract Dispute
    </h3>

    <p>
      In June 2022, rumours emerged suggesting Piastri would drive for {wikiLink("Williams", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Grand_Prix_Engineering")} in 2023 on loan from {wikiLink("Alpine", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team")}, who were initially expected to retain {wikiLink("Esteban Ocon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon")} and {wikiLink("Fernando Alonso", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso")}. However, in August, {wikiLink("Alonso", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso")} announced that he would leave the team to replace the retiring {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")} at {wikiLink("Aston Martin", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martin_in_Formula_One")}. 
    </p>

    <p>
      {wikiLink("Alpine", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team")} then announced that Piastri would replace Alonso in 2023, although the press release contained no quotes from Piastri himself. Piastri immediately rejected Alpine's announcement via a post on Twitter, stating that he had not signed a contract with the team and that he would not be driving for them in 2023. {wikiLink("Alpine team principal Otmar Szafnauer", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otmar_Szafnauer")} followed up by criticising Piastri's actions and "integrity as a human being", saying that he expected loyalty from the former academy driver, and threatened to take the contract matters to court. Shortly after Piastri's rebuffal, rumours speculated that he instead was looking for a drive with {wikiLink("McLaren", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren")}. 
    </p>

    <p>
      A hearing of the FIA's Contract Recognition Board (CRB) commenced on 29 August to determine whether Piastri was contracted to Alpine, or if he was free to join a different team for 2023. Had Alpine won the case, they could have obligated Piastri to fulfil his contract and race for the team in 2023, or sought a compensation fee for Piastri's services from any other interested teams. Prior to the {wikiLink("Dutch Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Dutch_Grand_Prix")}, the CRB ruled against Alpine, and Piastri shortly announced he would be joining {wikiLink("McLaren", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren")} from 2023 onwards. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In their final judgement, the CRB also revealed that Piastri had signed his {wikiLink("McLaren", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren")} contract almost two months earlier on 4 July – the day after the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_British_Grand_Prix")}. This contract initially only guaranteed Piastri a reserve role for 2023, with an upgrade to a race seat dependent on {wikiLink("McLaren", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren")} agreeing a contract termination with {wikiLink("Daniel Ricciardo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo")} – which they confirmed on 24 August, shortly before the CRB hearing. Piastri said a "breakdown in trust" between him and {wikiLink("Alpine", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team")} was behind his decision to leave the Enstone-based team.

      Piastri raced for {wikiLink("McLaren", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren")} in 2023 alongside {wikiLink("Lando Norris", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris")}. {wikiLink("Alpine", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team")} agreed to end Piastri's contract early to allow him to join McLaren in the post-season testing session immediately after the {wikiLink("2022 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}. In his first race, the {wikiLink("Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, he qualified 18th and was running in eighth place when an electrical issue forced his retirement.

      He reached Q3 at the {wikiLink("Saudi Arabian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")} and qualified eighth, but first-lap contact with {wikiLink("Pierre Gasly", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gasly")} necessitated a front wing change.

A "major failure" on his {wikiLink("MCL60", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MCL60")} produced a 19th-place finish at the {wikiLink("Miami Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Miami_Grand_Prix")}.

    <p>
      He scored points at the {wikiLink("Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Monaco_Grand_Prix")} in 10th place.

      He qualified fourth at the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")} and ran in second place in the early laps before dropping to fifth.

    </p>

    <p>
      On 20 September, Piastri signed a contract extension with McLaren until the end of 2026.
