      In early 2016, Piastri landed his first major sponsorship, HP Tuners (founded and owned by his father), which helped fund his racing career.

      He took three consecutive second-place finishes at both {wikiLink("Hungaroring", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungaroring")} races and the first Silverstone feature race, before his first retirement of the season came at the following Silverstone sprint race due to a stuck-open DRS. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Teammate Sargeant took the lead of the championship at the second Silverstone feature race after Piastri struggled with reliability issues in qualifying. Piastri started fifth for the sprint race in {wikiLink("Barcelona", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_Barcelona-Catalunya")}, overtook multiple cars and held his position to take his second victory.

    <p>
      Title rival Sargeant finished sixth, leaving both drivers tied on 160 points going into the final race. Sargeant was eliminated on the first lap.
