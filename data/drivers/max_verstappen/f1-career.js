    <p>During the first practice session at the {wikiLink("2014 Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen replaced {wikiLink("Jean-Éric Vergne", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-%C3%89ric_Vergne")} as part of his preparation for a full-time seat at {wikiLink("Toro Rosso", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Toro_Rosso")} in the {wikiLink("2015 Formula One World Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. Aged 17 years and three days, Verstappen was the youngest person in history to participate in a Formula One race weekend. In August 2014, Verstappen joined the {wikiLink("Red Bull Junior Team", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Junior_Team")} after testing a Formula Renault 3.5 car. He also considered an offer from {wikiLink("Mercedes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One")} to join their {wikiLink("Mercedes Junior Team", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Junior_Team")}.</p>

        Verstappen (pictured at the {wikiLink("2015 Malaysian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Malaysian_Grand_Prix")}) became the youngest driver in Formula One history at the {wikiLink("2015 Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, aged 17.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Verstappen then became the {wikiLink("youngest driver to start a World Championship race", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_driver_records#Youngest_drivers_to_start_a_race")} through joining {wikiLink("Toro Rosso", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Toro_Rosso")}'s race drivers' line-up with {wikiLink("Carlos Sainz", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr.")} as his teammate, in his Grand Prix debut as a full-time driver at the {wikiLink("2015 Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Australian_Grand_Prix")} at the age of 17 years, 166 days—breaking {wikiLink("Jaime Alguersuari", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Alguersuari")}'s existing record by almost two years. In this first race, Verstappen ran in points-scoring positions until he was forced to retire due to an engine failure. However, at the subsequent race in {wikiLink("Malaysia", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Malaysian_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen qualified sixth and finished the race in seventh place, scoring his first Formula One points aged 17 years, 180 days, breaking the record of the then-{wikiLink("youngest driver to score World Championship points", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_driver_records#Youngest_drivers_to_score_points")}.</p>

    <p>At the {wikiLink("2015 Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen was involved in a high-speed collision with {wikiLink("Romain Grosjean", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romain_Grosjean")}, after clipping the back of Grosjean's {wikiLink("Lotus", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_F1")} on the approach to the tight first corner, Sainte Devote, and crashed into the barriers at high speed. Verstappen was given a five-place grid penalty for causing the accident, and was branded "dangerous" by {wikiLink("Williams", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Grand_Prix_Engineering")} driver {wikiLink("Felipe Massa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Massa")}.</p>

    <p>Verstappen began the 2016 season at {wikiLink("Toro Rosso", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Toro_Rosso")}, again alongside {wikiLink("Carlos Sainz", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr.")}. Verstappen qualified fifth for the opening race of the season in {wikiLink("Australia", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, but during the race made several radio calls to his team due to frustration at being behind Sainz on track before Verstappen's Toro Rosso came into contact with his teammate's car whilst attempting to pass him with three laps to go, and he eventually finished tenth. Verstappen enjoyed a more successful weekend at the following race in {wikiLink("Bahrain", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, finishing sixth to score Toro Rosso's first-ever points at the Sakhir circuit.</p>

    <p>
      On 5 May 2016, following the {wikiLink("Russian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Russian_Grand_Prix")}, Red Bull Racing announced that Verstappen would replace Daniil Kvyat starting from the {wikiLink("Spanish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Spanish_Grand_Prix")}, with Kvyat returning to Toro Rosso. Team Principal {wikiLink("Christian Horner", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner")} stated that Verstappen had shown "outstanding talent". He qualified fourth and jumped to second on lap one following a collision between {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")} and {wikiLink("Nico Rosberg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Rosberg")}. Verstappen took the lead through a two-stop strategy and held off {wikiLink("Kimi Räikkönen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimi_R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen")} to win his first Formula One race, becoming the youngest ever Grand Prix winner at 18 years and 228 days, breaking the record previously held by {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")}.
    </p>

    <p>
      In his first eight races with Red Bull, Verstappen achieved six top-five finishes including four podiums.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the {wikiLink("2016 Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen collided with {wikiLink("Kimi Räikkönen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimi_R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen")} at the first corner, pushed several drivers wide at Les Combes, and aggressively defended against Räikkönen on the Kemmel straight. His driving was criticised, with Räikkönen saying he could cause a huge accident. {wikiLink("Christian Horner", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner")} called it "on the edge", while {wikiLink("Charlie Whiting", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Whiting")} summoned Verstappen for a discussion and issued a gentle warning. The FIA later banned defensive moves under braking following growing driver concerns.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the {wikiLink("2016 Brazilian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Brazilian_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen qualified fourth. In the rain-hit race, he narrowly avoided a crash on the main straight, dropped to 16th after switching back to rain tyres, and made a remarkable recovery through a series of overtakes to finish third. His drive was hailed as "The Verstappen Show" by {wikiLink("Toto Wolff", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toto_Wolff")}, who claimed "physics [were] being redefined". However, {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")} accused him of pushing him off at Junção, though no penalty was issued.

    <p>During the first 14 races of the 2017 season, Verstappen suffered seven retirements, four due to mechanical issues, and three due to first lap collisions in the {wikiLink("2017 Spanish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Spanish_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("2017 Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Austrian_Grand_Prix")}, and {wikiLink("2017 Singapore Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Singapore_Grand_Prix")}. Of the races he finished, however, he claimed a third place in the {wikiLink("2017 Chinese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Chinese_Grand_Prix")} and in another five races he finished fourth or fifth.</p>

    <p>From the {wikiLink("2017 Malaysian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Malaysian_Grand_Prix")} onward, Verstappen enjoyed a surge of success. He won his second Formula One race a day after his 20th birthday, passing then three-time champion {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")} for the lead in the early stages of the race. He finished second in the following {wikiLink("2017 Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Japanese_Grand_Prix")} and then finished third at the {wikiLink("2017 United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_States_Grand_Prix")}, but was classified fourth after his final lap overtake on {wikiLink("Kimi Räikkönen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimi_R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen")} was deemed illegal. He won his third Formula One race at the {wikiLink("2017 Mexican Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Mexican_Grand_Prix")} after passing {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")} on the opening lap.</p>

    <p>In the first six races of the {wikiLink("2018 Formula One World Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, Verstappen had been involved in at least one incident in each race. In the {wikiLink("2018 Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, he qualified fourth but fell behind {wikiLink("Kevin Magnussen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen")} at the start. In his attempts to retake the position he ran wide multiple times and damaged his car, with a spin causing him to fall further down the order. He recovered to eventually finish the race in sixth place. At the next race in {wikiLink("2018 Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, he crashed during qualifying and started in 15th place. He had a productive first lap after which he found himself in the points while challenging {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")}. He attempted an overtake on the reigning World Champion at the start of lap two, but collided with the Mercedes driver and suffered a puncture that ultimately led to suspension damage, forcing him out of the race.</p>

    <p>At the next race in {wikiLink("2018 Chinese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Chinese_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen qualified fifth and had moved up to third at the end of the first lap. Both Red Bull drivers pitted for fresh tyres during a safety car which left them with a tyre advantage over the front-runners ahead. In an overtake attempt on {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")} for third place, Verstappen collided with the championship leader, causing him to fall to eighth and receive a 10-second penalty. He recovered to fourth place, with his penalty causing him to be classified fifth. Teammate Ricciardo went on to win the race. In {wikiLink("2018 Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen was embroiled in a race-long battle with Ricciardo for fourth place. After numerous position changes between the two teammates during the race, Ricciardo ran into the back of Verstappen during an overtake attempt from which the Dutchman aggressively defended, causing the retirement of both cars. Both drivers were blamed by the team and reprimanded by the stewards. Verstappen bounced back in {wikiLink("2018 Spanish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Spanish_Grand_Prix")} with his first podium of the season by finishing third behind the Mercedes drivers, holding off {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")}. However, the race was also not without incident as he had run into the back of {wikiLink("Lance Stroll", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Stroll")} during the virtual safety car period, causing minor front wing damage.</p>

    <p>In {wikiLink("2018 Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen made another error and crashed near the end of the third free practice session in an incident which closely resembled a crash he had at the same spot {wikiLink("two years earlier", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Monaco_Grand_Prix#Qualifying")}. His team could not repair his car in time for qualifying and Verstappen had to start the race from the back of the grid. Verstappen did not compete and did not set a lap time in qualifying, therefore teammate Ricciardo pressed home Red Bull's advantage at the track by taking pole position and the race win. Verstappen managed to salvage two points by finishing ninth place, overtaking six cars on track. Team principal Christian Horner commented on Verstappen's start of the season, saying he "needed to stop making these mistakes" and that he could "learn from his teammate", while {wikiLink("Helmut Marko", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Marko")}, head of driver development at Red Bull, said that Verstappen was "too impatient". Verstappen now lay in sixth place in the championship with 35 points, only three points ahead of {wikiLink("Fernando Alonso", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso")} in the McLaren, and 37 points behind his teammate in third, who had taken two wins in the first six races.</p>

    <p>In {wikiLink("2018 Canadian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Canadian_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen topped all three practice sessions and qualified third, two-tenths off {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")} in pole position. He eventually finished third and set the fastest lap of the race. The following race in {wikiLink("2018 French Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_French_Grand_Prix")} brought him second place. In {wikiLink("2018 Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Austrian_Grand_Prix")} — Red Bull's home track — he started fourth on the grid, passed {wikiLink("Kimi Räikkönen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimi_R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen")} before taking advantage of retirement from {wikiLink("Valtteri Bottas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas")} and a botched pit-stop strategy by {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")} to claim the fourth race victory of his career. In {wikiLink("2018 British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_British_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen was plagued by issues, retiring from the race due to a brake problem. He would then finish fourth in {wikiLink("2018 German Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_German_Grand_Prix")} after strategy errors let a recovering Hamilton get past him. Verstappen ended the first half of the season with a retirement in {wikiLink("2018 Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")} and was narrowly behind his teammate in the championship.</p>

    <p>Verstappen enjoyed a very strong second half of the season, achieving podium finishes in {wikiLink("2018 Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("2018 Singapore Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Singapore_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("2018 Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Japanese_Grand_Prix")} and the {wikiLink("2018 United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_United_States_Grand_Prix")}, the latter of which he achieved second place having started from 18th on the grid. At the {wikiLink("2018 Mexican Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Mexican_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen had a better start than Ricciardo and took the lead of the race into the first corner, overtaking the fast-starting Mercedes of Hamilton to earn his fifth career win. He was poised to win the {wikiLink("2018 Brazilian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Brazilian_Grand_Prix")} before colliding with {wikiLink("Esteban Ocon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon")} who was trying to unlap himself. After the collision, Verstappen finished second behind Hamilton. During an argument with Ocon after the race, Verstappen pushed the Force India driver and was given two days of "public service" as a penalty by the FIA. He finished his season with another podium as he finished third in {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}.</p>

    <p>Verstappen ended the season in fourth place in the championship with 249 points, claiming two wins, eleven podium finishes, and two fastest laps.</p>

      In {wikiLink("2019", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Formula_One_World_Championship")} Red Bull switched from Renault to {wikiLink("Honda", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_in_Formula_One")} power units. After {wikiLink("Daniel Ricciardo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo")} moved to {wikiLink("Renault", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_in_Formula_One")} for 2019, Verstappen was joined at Red Bull by {wikiLink("Pierre Gasly", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gasly")}. Verstappen qualified in fourth and finished third in {wikiLink("Australia", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, the first podium finish for a Honda-powered driver since the {wikiLink("2008 British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_British_Grand_Prix")}. Verstappen was on course for a second third-place finish in {wikiLink("Bahrain", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")} before a late safety car prevented him from overtaking {wikiLink("Charles Leclerc", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc")}'s ailing Ferrari, keeping him in fourth place. Two more fourth-place finishes followed in {wikiLink("China", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Chinese_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Azerbaijan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}, and a podium in {wikiLink("Spain", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Spanish_Grand_Prix")} in third place. In {wikiLink("Monaco", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen qualified in third place. He was released into the path of {wikiLink("Valtteri Bottas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas")} during the drivers' pit stops, gaining second place but receiving a 5-second penalty as a result. Verstappen crossed the line in second place but was demoted to fourth by the penalty.
    </p>

    <p>
      In {wikiLink("Canada", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Canadian_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen's final lap in Q2 was hampered by a red flag brought out by {wikiLink("Kevin Magnussen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen")}'s crash. This caused Verstappen to qualify 11th and start the race in ninth place. He later recovered to finish fifth. In {wikiLink("France", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_French_Grand_Prix")} he started and finished in fourth place. In {wikiLink("Austria", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Austrian_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen started third but suffered a poor start, dropping down to eighth. After a charge towards the front, he made his way up to second before controversially passing {wikiLink("Charles Leclerc", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc")} for the lead of the race with three laps to go. This marked the first Honda-powered race victory since the {wikiLink("2006 Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}. In {wikiLink("Britain", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_British_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen, running in third place, was hit from behind during an overtake attempt by {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")} and spun into the gravel. Verstappen was able to continue and crossed the line in fifth place.
    </p>

    <p>
      The wet and chaotic {wikiLink("German Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_German_Grand_Prix")} began similarly to the race in Austria for Verstappen, as a poor start caused him to fall behind. However, he would inherit the lead midway through the race after a crash by race leader {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")}. Verstappen would go on to extend his lead after the track began to dry, claiming his second victory of the season. In {wikiLink("Hungary", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}, he claimed the first pole position of his career and led most of the race before being passed in the closing laps by Hamilton, who had made another stop for fresh tyres in a gamble to catch the leader.

    Before the {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen received a new teammate in {wikiLink("Alexander Albon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Albon")} after {wikiLink("Pierre Gasly", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gasly")} was demoted back to Toro Rosso. In the race, Verstappen had a poor start and collided with {wikiLink("Kimi Räikkönen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimi_Räikkönen")} at the first corner, resulting in suspension damage and causing Verstappen's first retirement of the season. In {wikiLink("Italy", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Italian_Grand_Prix")}, he did not set a time during qualifying after his car lost power in Q1, but he was already required to start from the back of the grid due to an engine component penalty. After damaging his front wing on the first lap, he recovered to finish the race in eighth place. Third and fourth-place finishes followed in {wikiLink("Singapore", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Singapore_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Russia", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Russian_Grand_Prix")}, respectively. After suffering damage in a first-lap collision with {wikiLink("Charles Leclerc", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc")} in {wikiLink("Japan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen suffered his second retirement of the season.
    </p>

    <p>
    In {wikiLink("Mexico", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Mexican_Grand_Prix")}, he qualified in first place after setting the fastest lap-time of the session, before being handed a grid penalty for ignoring yellow flags after a crash by {wikiLink("Valtteri Bottas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas")}. Verstappen suffered a puncture early in the race after making contact with Bottas, falling to the back of the field before eventually recovering to sixth place. A third-place finish in the {wikiLink("United States", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_United_States_Grand_Prix")} followed, before Verstappen took the second pole position of his career in {wikiLink("Brazil", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Brazilian_Grand_Prix")}. In a chaotic race, he passed {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")} for the lead on two occasions before going on to claim his third victory of the season. Verstappen ended the season with a second-place finish in {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}.
    </p>

    Verstappen continued to race for {wikiLink("Red Bull", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing")} in {wikiLink("2020", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, alongside {wikiLink("Alexander Albon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Albon")}. At the {wikiLink("2020 Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Austrian_Grand_Prix")}, he started second but retired early in the race after a flywheel-related problem caused an electronic issue within the power unit. {wikiLink("Honda", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_in_Formula_One")} introduced countermeasures in response to the retirement.
    </p>

    <p>
    At the {wikiLink("2020 Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}, he crashed in wet conditions during the {wikiLink("formation lap", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_lap")} while on his way to the starting grid, but was able to drive the car back where his mechanics repaired the suspension just in time for the race start. After the repairs, Verstappen progressed from seventh on the grid to finish second. Verstappen claimed his first win of the season at the {wikiLink("70th Anniversary Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/70th_Anniversary_Grand_Prix")} at {wikiLink("Silverstone", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit")}, having started from fourth.
    </p>

    <p>
    Verstappen clinched second place at the {wikiLink("2020 Spanish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Spanish_Grand_Prix")}, after qualifying in third. At the {wikiLink("2020 Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}, he scored a podium in third place, following his third place on the starting grid. He suffered from two consecutive DNFs at the {wikiLink("2020 Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Italian_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("2020 Tuscan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Tuscan_Grand_Prix")}, after which he lost second place in the Championship.

    At the {wikiLink("2020 Eifel Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Eifel_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen finished in second after qualifying in third. He also managed to get the fastest lap of the race. At the {wikiLink("2020 Portuguese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Portuguese_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen qualified third, however a poor first lap meant that he dropped back down the order to fifth place. He recovered to third and took his 40th podium in Formula 1. At the {wikiLink("2020 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen looked set to claim second due to {wikiLink("Valtteri Bottas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas")}' ailing Mercedes slowing down, but a sudden puncture denied him any chance of a podium finish; Verstappen spun, resulting in his fourth retirement of the 2020 season.
    </p>

    <p>
    During Free Practice for the Portuguese Grand Prix, Verstappen was criticised for comments he made on the team radio after a collision with {wikiLink("Lance Stroll", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Stroll")}, where he used the words "retard" and "mongol" in response to the clash. Verstappen admitted following the session that the word choices he used were "not correct". The Mongolian government and the Mongol identity asked Verstappen to apologise for the comments; the Mongolian government also urged the {wikiLink("FIA", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_Internationale_de_l%27Automobile")} to take action on the comments he made.
    </p>

    <p>

    <p>
      At the {wikiLink("Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen topped all the practice sessions and subsequently took a career fourth pole position. This was the first time he achieved back-to-back pole positions. He fought {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")} for the race victory, and on lap 53 Verstappen overtook Hamilton, but went off track whilst doing so, resulting in him being instructed by race control to let Hamilton back into the lead and ultimately finishing second behind Hamilton.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the next race, the {wikiLink("Emilia Romagna Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen qualified third with teammate {wikiLink("Sergio Pérez", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P%C3%A9rez")} second, marking the first time he was out-qualified by a teammate since the {wikiLink("2019 Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Italian_Grand_Prix")}.

This allowed Hamilton to overtake Verstappen with several laps remaining. Hamilton took the victory, while Verstappen finished second and secured the fastest lap, increasing Hamilton's championship lead to 14 points.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the next race in {wikiLink("Monaco", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen qualified second behind {wikiLink("Charles Leclerc", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc")}, but Leclerc suffered a driveshaft failure before the start.

The following week at the {wikiLink("Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Austrian_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen completed his first career grand slam — pole position, fastest lap, led every lap, and race win — becoming the youngest driver to do so.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_British_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen collided with Hamilton at Copse corner on the first lap in a 51g crash.

    </p>

    <p>
      In the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen's car was damaged in a multi-car collision caused by {wikiLink("Valtteri Bottas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas")}.

    <p>
      In the {wikiLink("Mexico City Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Mexico_City_Grand_Prix")}, Verstappen qualified third but made a brilliant start to overtake both {wikiLink("Valtteri Bottas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas")} and Hamilton into turn one.

    </p>

    <p>
      Verstappen and Hamilton entered the decisive {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")} tied on points. Verstappen qualified on pole but lost the lead at the start. He attempted a re-pass on Hamilton, who cut the corner but retained the lead. Late in the race, a safety car caused by {wikiLink("Nicholas Latifi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Latifi")} allowed Verstappen to close the gap.
    </p>

    <p>
      Race director {wikiLink("Michael Masi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Masi")} allowed only certain lapped cars to unlap themselves, setting up a final lap shootout. On the last lap, Verstappen overtook Hamilton to win the race and become the first Dutch Formula One World Champion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mercedes protested the result, arguing that all lapped cars should have been allowed to unlap themselves. The protest was rejected, confirming Verstappen as World Champion. The FIA later amended the rules for clarity in 2022.
    </p>

    <p>
      Verstappen was named Driver of the Year by {wikiLink("Autosport", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosport")} and The Race, and topped polls conducted among drivers and team principals. {wikiLink("Mark Hughes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hughes_(journalist)")} of {wikiLink("Motor Sport", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_Sport_(magazine)")} described his season as a "stunning combination of speed and racecraft, totally fearless, incredible tenacity and ability to comeback from adversity."

    <p>
      In March 2022, Verstappen signed a five-year contract extension with {wikiLink("Red Bull Racing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing")} for the 2023 to 2028 seasons. From this season onward, he would use the number 1 instead of his regular number 33 as the reigning world champion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Verstappen retired from second place at the season-opening {wikiLink("Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")} with a fuel system issue. He won the {wikiLink("Saudi Arabian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")}, having benefited from a pit stop during safety car conditions to pass teammate and pole-sitter Pérez, but suffered another fuel-related retirement from second place at the {wikiLink("Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Australian_Grand_Prix")}. This left him 46 points behind championship leader {wikiLink("Charles Leclerc", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc")} after three races. Verstappen responded by winning the next three races; he achieved sprint victory and a {wikiLink("grand slam", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(Formula_One)")} at the {wikiLink("Emilia Romagna Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix")}, won from third on the grid at the {wikiLink("Miami Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Miami_Grand_Prix")} and gained from Leclerc's retirement at the {wikiLink("Spanish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Spanish_Grand_Prix")} to lead the Drivers' Championship. Further wins came at the {wikiLink("Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}, where Leclerc again retired, and from pole position at the {wikiLink("Canadian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Canadian_Grand_Prix")}. Verstappen qualified second at the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_British_Grand_Prix")}, but floor damage from running over debris harmed his pace and resulted in a seventh-place finish. He took pole position at the {wikiLink("Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Austrian_Grand_Prix")} and won the sprint, but was overtaken by Leclerc in the race and finished second, reducing his championship lead over Leclerc to 38 points.
    </p>

    <p>
      Following this, Verstappen went on to win five races consecutively. Pole-sitter {wikiLink("Charles Leclerc", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc")} crashed out of the {wikiLink("French Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_French_Grand_Prix")}, allowing Verstappen to win. Power unit issues meant he qualified tenth for the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}, but overtakes in the opening laps and pit stop {wikiLink("undercuts", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_motorsport_terms#U")} meant he went on to take victory, despite briefly losing the lead after a spin. He set the fastest qualifying time at the {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Belgian_Grand_Prix")} but was demoted to 14th on the grid with a power unit components penalty. Despite this, he progressed to the race lead by lap 12 and went on to win. He took pole position and his 30th race victory at his home race, the {wikiLink("Dutch Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Dutch_Grand_Prix")}, and then won from seventh on the grid at the {wikiLink("Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Italian_Grand_Prix")}.
    </p>

    <p>
      Verstappen's winning streak was ended at the {wikiLink("Singapore Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Singapore_Grand_Prix")}. He ran out of fuel in qualifying and started the race eighth. He lost places at the start and later had to make an extra pit stop due to a tyre lock-up, finishing seventh. Victory from pole at the shortened {wikiLink("Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Japanese_Grand_Prix")} gave him a 113-point lead in the standings with four races remaining, securing him his second World Drivers' Championship.

    <p>
      {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")} was his fifteenth victory of the year, breaking the record of thirteen race wins in a season shared by {wikiLink("Michael Schumacher", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schumacher")} in {wikiLink("2004", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Formula_One_World_Championship")} and {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")} in {wikiLink("2013", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Formula_One_World_Championship")}.

His season began with a win from pole at the {wikiLink("2023 Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}. A driveshaft failure in qualifying at the {wikiLink("2023 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")} resulted in a 15th-place start, but he gained positions in the race to finish second behind Pérez. He again won from pole at the {wikiLink("2023 Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Australian_Grand_Prix")} despite losing positions to the Mercedes drivers during the race, but finished second to Pérez, who made a safety car pit stop, at the {wikiLink("2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}.
    </p>

    <p>
      After this began Verstappen's record-breaking win streak. He started ninth at the {wikiLink("2023 Miami Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Miami_Grand_Prix")} as red flags in qualifying aborted his lap but passed the drivers ahead including pole-sitter Pérez to win. The next four races, the {wikiLink("2023 Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("2023 Spanish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Spanish_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("2023 Canadian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Canadian_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("2023 Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Austrian_Grand_Prix")}, were won comfortably from pole position by Verstappen, including Red Bull's 100th victory in Canada and a sprint win in Austria. He took pole at the {wikiLink("2023 British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_British_Grand_Prix")} but briefly lost the lead to {wikiLink("Lando Norris", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris")} at the start before regaining the position to win.

He went on to overtake Pérez to win the race. He won from pole at the rain-affected {wikiLink("2023 Dutch Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Dutch_Grand_Prix")} and was victorious again at the {wikiLink("2023 Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Italian_Grand_Prix")} despite qualifying behind {wikiLink("Carlos Sainz Jr.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr.")}. This victory marked his tenth consecutive win, breaking {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")}'s record of nine from 2013, and Red Bull's fifteenth consecutive win, a record previously held by {wikiLink("McLaren", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren")} with eleven in 1988.
    </p>
