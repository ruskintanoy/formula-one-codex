      pressured Albon into a mistake to take the lead — though both still needed to pit. On fresh tyres, Albon and Rowland mounted a comeback for the podium, with Albon finishing 5th.

      In the sprint race, Albon started 4th and battled Leclerc for multiple laps, eventually being passed for fifth. He later dropped to 8th at the finish.

      Albon missed the{" "}
      {wikiLink("Baku round", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Baku_Formula_2_round")}{" "}
      due to a broken collarbone sustained in a mountain biking incident — making it unsafe to compete with the F2's over-the-shoulder belts.

      Albon was back in action for the fifth round of the championship, stating that his initial feeling on returning to action after breaking his collarbone was "a lot better" than he expected. He confirmed that the bone was still "clearly broken" following an x-ray on the Tuesday before the race weekend, and explained that the main issue he is having in the car is a "numb feeling" from the scar he received during successful surgery after the crash.

    <p>
      Albon finished the practice session in 8th, which showed that despite the injury, the chance for his first podium in Formula 2 was a possibility. Albon qualified in 4th for the Feature Race, however, he was later promoted to third on the provisional starting grid after{" "}
