        On 26 November 2018, {wikiLink("Nissan e.dams", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAMS")} terminated their {wikiLink("Formula E", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_E")} contract with Albon after rumours he was to sign for {wikiLink("Scuderia Toro Rosso", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Toro_Rosso")} in Formula One. On the same day, Toro Rosso announced Albon would join the team for {wikiLink("2019", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Formula_One_World_Championship")} alongside {wikiLink("Daniil Kvyat", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Kvyat")}, and thus Albon's relationship with {wikiLink("Red Bull Racing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing")}, which had ended seven years prior, was restored. He is the second {wikiLink("Thai driver", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_drivers_from_Thailand")} to compete in Formula One and the first since {wikiLink("Prince Birabongse Bhanudej", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birabongse_Bhanudej")} competed in {wikiLink("1954", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Formula_One_season")}.
      </p>

      <p>
        Albon qualified thirteenth and finished fourteenth in his debut race, the {wikiLink("2019 Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Australian_Grand_Prix")}. He scored his first points at the following race, the {wikiLink("2019 Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, finishing ninth. A heavy crash in practice for the {wikiLink("2019 Chinese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Chinese_Grand_Prix")} forced him to miss qualifying and start the race from the pit lane. He recovered in the race to finish tenth and win the <i>Driver Of The Day</i> award. He reached the third qualifying session (Q3) for the first time at the {wikiLink("2019 Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Monaco_Grand_Prix")} and finished the race eighth. Damage caused by contact with {wikiLink("Antonio Giovinazzi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Giovinazzi")} on the first lap of the {wikiLink("2019 Canadian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Canadian_Grand_Prix")} later led to Albon's first race retirement.
      </p>

      <div className="clear-both"></div>

      <p>
        Albon's best qualifying result with Toro Rosso came at the {wikiLink("2019 British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_British_Grand_Prix")} with ninth place, although he failed to score points in the race. Albon started the {wikiLink("2019 German Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_German_Grand_Prix")} in sixteenth place. He and Toro Rosso took advantage of changing weather conditions to run as high as fourth and eventually finish sixth, albeit behind teammate {wikiLink("Daniil Kvyat", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Kvyat")} who claimed the team's first podium finish in over ten years. At this stage of the season, Albon had scored 16 points to Kvyat's 27.

        After the {wikiLink("2019 Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("Red Bull Racing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing")} announced that Albon would be replacing {wikiLink("Pierre Gasly", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gasly")} and partnering {wikiLink("Max Verstappen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen")} at the team from the {wikiLink("2019 Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Belgian_Grand_Prix")} onwards, with Gasly returning to {wikiLink("Toro Rosso", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Toro_Rosso")}. On the mid-season change, Red Bull stated: "The team will use the next nine races to evaluate Alex's performance in order to make an informed decision as to who will drive alongside Max in 2020."
      </p>

      <p>
        At the {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}, Albon was forced to start from seventeenth place due to a power unit change. He recovered to finish fifth in the race after passing {wikiLink("Sergio Pérez", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P%C3%A9rez")} on the final lap. After sixth-place finishes at the {wikiLink("2019 Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Italian_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("2019 Singapore Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Singapore_Grand_Prix")} Grands Prix, Albon finished fifth at the {wikiLink("2019 Russian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Russian_Grand_Prix")} having crashed in qualifying and started from the pit lane. Albon and Verstappen set identical lap times in qualifying at the {wikiLink("2019 Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Japanese_Grand_Prix")} and Albon finished a career-best fourth in the race. He finished fifth at both the {wikiLink("2019 Mexican Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Mexican_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("2019 United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_United_States_Grand_Prix")}, despite taking damage on the opening lap and making three pit stops at the latter. He was in second place on the penultimate lap of the {wikiLink("2019 Brazilian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Brazilian_Grand_Prix")}, but was hit by {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")} during an overtaking attempt, dropping Albon to fourteenth place at the finish.

He finished sixth at the {wikiLink("Sakhir Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Sakhir_Grand_Prix")}, and fourth at the {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}, pressuring Hamilton in the closing stages.

        Albon continued at {wikiLink("Williams", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Grand_Prix_Engineering")} alongside {wikiLink("Sargeant", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant")} for {wikiLink("2024", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. He qualified and finished outside the top ten at the season-opening {wikiLink("Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, with the team stating that both drivers were dealing with engine overheating issues during the race. He and {wikiLink("Kevin Magnussen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen")} collided at the {wikiLink("Saudi Arabian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")} and Albon went on to finish eleventh.

        He crashed in the first practice session at the {wikiLink("Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Australian_Grand_Prix")} and Williams were unable to repair his car, nor did they have a spare chassis. Team principal {wikiLink("James Vowles", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Vowles")} described the situation as "a reflection of how behind we were in the winter period". The team decided to withdraw Sargeant from the event and allow Albon to use the one remaining car. He finished the race eleventh. He qualified fourteenth for the {wikiLink("Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Japanese_Grand_Prix")} but was eliminated in a first-lap crash with {wikiLink("Daniel Ricciardo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo")}. On 15 May, Williams confirmed that Albon has signed a multi-year extension to stay with the team.

        Albon did not score points in the next three races which included him retiring in {wikiLink("Imola", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix")} due to issues putting the tyre on at his pit stop taking him out of the points battle. Looking to bounce back Albon qualified 9th at the {wikiLink("Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}. He then kept hold of his position to finish in 9th place which marked his and Williams' first points of the season. Albon then qualified 10th for the {wikiLink("Canadian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Canadian_Grand_Prix")} but retired from the race whilst running in the points on lap 52 after {wikiLink("Carlos Sainz", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr.")} spun into him sending him into the wall.

        After finishing out of the points in {wikiLink("Spain", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Spanish_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Austria", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Austrian_Grand_Prix")}, Albon then earned his second points finish of the season by finishing 9th at the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_British_Grand_Prix")}. This meant at the halfway point of the season Albon was 17th in the drivers' championship with 4 points.

At {wikiLink("Monza", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Italian_Grand_Prix")}, Albon scored Williams' third points finish of the season taking another 9th place. During the {wikiLink("Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}, Albon benefitted from a late crash between {wikiLink("Sergio Pérez", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P%C3%A9rez")} and {wikiLink("Carlos Sainz Jr.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr.")}, which saw Albon finish seventh, allowing Williams to overtake Alpine in the {wikiLink("World Constructors' Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Constructors%27_Championship")}.

      <p>
        Albon did not start the {wikiLink("São Paulo Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix")} after crashing heavily in the third qualifying session; qualifying had been rescheduled to Sunday morning, leaving Williams unable to repair his chassis in time for the race two hours later. A cooling issue forced Albon to retire midway through the {wikiLink("Las Vegas Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Las_Vegas_Grand_Prix")}, while he finished 15th and 11th in the {wikiLink("Qatar Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Qatar_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}, respectively.
