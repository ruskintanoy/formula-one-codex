    <br /><br />

    Born and raised in{" "}
    {wikiLink("Stevenage", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevenage")}, Hamilton began his career in{" "}
    {wikiLink("karting", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kart_racing")} aged six, winning several national titles and attracting the attention of{" "}
    {wikiLink("Ron Dennis", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Dennis")}, who signed him to the{" "}
    {wikiLink("McLaren-Mercedes Young Driver Programme", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_Young_Driver_Programme")} in 1998. 

    After winning the{" "}
    {wikiLink("direct-drive", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KF1")}{" "}
    {wikiLink("Karting World Cup", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karting_World_Cup")} and{" "}
    {wikiLink("European Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karting_European_Championship")} in 2000, Hamilton progressed to{" "}
    {wikiLink("junior formulae", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_racing")}, where his successes included winning the{" "}
    {wikiLink("Formula 3 Euro Series", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Formula_3_Euro_Series")} and the{" "}
    {wikiLink("GP2 Series", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_GP2_Series")}.

    He subsequently signed for{" "}
    {wikiLink("McLaren", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren")} in{" "}
    {wikiLink("2007", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, becoming the first{" "}
    {wikiLink("black", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people")} driver to compete in Formula One at the{" "}
    {wikiLink("Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Australian_Grand_Prix")}. 

    In his rookie season, Hamilton won four{" "}
    {wikiLink("Grands Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_Grands_Prix")} and set several records as he finished runner-up to{" "}
    {wikiLink("Kimi Räikkönen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimi_R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen")} by one point.

    Hamilton won his maiden title in{" "}
    {wikiLink("2008", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, making a title-deciding overtake on the last lap of the{" "}
    {wikiLink("last race of the season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Brazilian_Grand_Prix")} to become the{" "}
    {wikiLink("then-youngest World Drivers' Champion", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_World_Drivers%27_Champions#Youngest_Drivers'_Champion")}.

    The{" "}
    {wikiLink("Red Bull", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing")}-{" "}
    {wikiLink("Renault", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_in_Formula_One")} combination prevailed throughout his remaining four seasons at McLaren, with Hamilton achieving multiple race wins in each, including his involvement in a four-way title battle in{" "}
    {wikiLink("2010", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Formula_One_World_Championship")}.
  
    Hamilton signed for{" "}
    {wikiLink("Mercedes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One")} in{" "}
    {wikiLink("2013", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Formula_One_World_Championship")} to partner his old karting teammate{" "}
    {wikiLink("Nico Rosberg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Rosberg")}, ending his 15-year association with McLaren. Following his maiden victory with the team at the{" "}
    {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}, new{" "}
    {wikiLink("engine regulations", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo-hybrid_engines_(Formula_One,_2014–2021)")} the{" "}
    {wikiLink("following season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Formula_One_season")} saw Mercedes emerge as the dominant force in Formula One.

    <br /><br />

    Over the next three seasons, Hamilton and Rosberg won 51 of 59 Grands Prix amidst their{" "}
    {wikiLink("fierce rivalry", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton–Rosberg_rivalry")}—widely known as{" "}
    <i>The {wikiLink("Silver", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Arrows")} War</i>—with Hamilton winning the former titles in{" "}
    {wikiLink("2014", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Formula_One_World_Championship")} and{" "}
    {wikiLink("2015", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, and Rosberg winning{" "}
    {wikiLink("the latter", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Formula_One_season")}. After Rosberg's retirement, Hamilton twice overturned mid-season point deficits to{" "}
    {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")} of{" "}
    {wikiLink("Ferrari", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari")} to claim his fourth and fifth titles in{" "}
    {wikiLink("2017", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Formula_One_World_Championship")} and{" "}
    {wikiLink("2018", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Formula_One_World_Championship")}.

    <br /><br />

    Hamilton won his sixth title in{" "}
    {wikiLink("2019", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, before breaking several records across his{" "}
    {wikiLink("2020", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Formula_One_World_Championship")} campaign—including the all-time win record at the{" "}
    {wikiLink("Portuguese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Portuguese_Grand_Prix")}—to claim his record-equalling seventh.

    Hamilton became the first driver to surpass 100 race wins and pole positions in{" "}
    {wikiLink("2021", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, finishing runner-up to{" "}
    {wikiLink("Max Verstappen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen")} amidst a{" "}
    {wikiLink("controversial finish", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix#Safety_car_controversy")}.

    Following winless campaigns in{" "}
    {wikiLink("2022", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Formula_One_World_Championship")} and{" "}
    {wikiLink("2023", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, he took his record-breaking ninth{" "}
    {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_British_Grand_Prix")} victory in{" "}
    {wikiLink("2024", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, his twelfth and final season with Mercedes.

    Hamilton signed for Ferrari in{" "}
    {wikiLink("2025", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, and is contracted to remain in the team until at least the end of{" "}
    {wikiLink("2026", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Formula_One_World_Championship")}.

    <br /><br />

    Hamilton has been credited with furthering Formula One's global following by appealing to a broader audience outside the sport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle, amongst his environmental and social activism. He has also become a prominent advocate in support of{" "}
    {wikiLink("racial justice", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_justice")} and increased diversity in motorsport.

    Hamilton was listed in the 2020 issue of{" "}
    {wikiLink("Time", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)")} as one of the{" "}
    {wikiLink("100 most influential people globally", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_100")}, and was{" "}
    {wikiLink("knighted", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Bachelor")} in the{" "}
