        Hamilton's success in the GP2 championship coincided with a vacancy at {wikiLink("McLaren-Mercedes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren-Mercedes")} following the departure of {wikiLink("Juan Pablo Montoya", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Pablo_Montoya")} to {wikiLink("NASCAR", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR")} and {wikiLink("Kimi Räikkönen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimi_R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen")} to {wikiLink("Ferrari", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari")}. Hamilton was given nearly 5,000 miles (8,000 km) of testing in the {wikiLink("McLaren MP4-21", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MP4-21")} to acclimatise himself to Formula One, alongside {wikiLink("Pedro de la Rosa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_de_la_Rosa")} and {wikiLink("Gary Paffett", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Paffett")}. Ultimately, Hamilton was confirmed as the team's second driver; the announcement was not made public for nearly two months, reportedly to avoid being overlooked by {wikiLink("Michael Schumacher", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schumacher")}'s retirement announcement.

        Hamilton's {wikiLink("maiden season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Formula_One_World_Championship")} in Formula One saw him partner two-time defending World Drivers' Champion {wikiLink("Fernando Alonso", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso")} at {wikiLink("McLaren", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren")}. At the season-opening {wikiLink("Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, Hamilton became the first—and, as of 2025, only—{wikiLink("black", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people")} driver to race in the series. After finishing third on debut, Hamilton went on to set several records, including the {wikiLink("most consecutive podium finishes from debut", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_driver_records#Other_driver_records")} (9), the {wikiLink("most wins in a debut season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_driver_records#Other_driver_records")} (4, shared with {wikiLink("Jacques Villeneuve", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Villeneuve")}), and the most points in a debut season (109). Acquiring the championship lead as early as the {wikiLink("fourth round", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Spanish_Grand_Prix")}, Hamilton became the youngest driver to lead the World Drivers' Championship. 
      </p>

      <p>
        After a series of misfortunes in the latter half of the season, including strategic missteps by McLaren in the closing rounds and a retirement at the {wikiLink("Chinese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Chinese_Grand_Prix")}, Hamilton's 12-point advantage in the standings evanesced. He finished runner-up in the championship to {wikiLink("Kimi Räikkönen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimi_R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen")} by one point, classified ahead of teammate Alonso whilst finishing level on points. Throughout the season, Hamilton and Alonso were involved in several incidents, which resulted in inter-team tensions, culminating in Alonso and McLaren terminating their contract by mutual consent. Hamilton signed a £50 million contract to stay with the team until the end of 2012.

      <p>
        During his veering final years with McLaren—a period largely dominated by {wikiLink("Red Bull", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing")}—Hamilton continued to score podium finishes and race victories, and challenged for titles. Major technical regulation changes in {wikiLink("2009", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Formula_One_World_Championship")} led to a challenging start for McLaren. Often qualifying outside of the top ten, and struggling to finish consistently on points, Hamilton's chances of defending his title became unfeasible. Major upgrades at the {wikiLink("2009 German Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_German_Grand_Prix")} saw a dramatic improvement in performance of the {wikiLink("MP4-24", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MP4-24")} car. From that point onward, Hamilton advanced from eleventh to fifth in the standings and outscored the rest of the field, securing two race victories and three additional podium finishes across the remaining nine rounds.

        In {wikiLink("2010", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, Hamilton was partnered by reigning World Drivers' Champion {wikiLink("Jenson Button", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenson_Button")}. Whilst McLaren struggled to match the outright pace of Red Bull and Ferrari, Hamilton engaged in a four-way title battle with Alonso, {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")} and {wikiLink("Mark Webber", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Webber_(racing_driver)")} throughout the season. At the {wikiLink("2010 Canadian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Canadian_Grand_Prix")}, he secured McLaren's only pole position of the season, and took the championship lead after winning the race. Hamilton's latter half of the season unravelled with a number of misfortunes, including race-ending collisions and mechanical failures, culminated in him losing vital points to his rivals, and ultimately, the championship lead. He entered the {wikiLink("2010 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")} with an outside chance of winning the title, but finished fourth in the standings as Vettel won his maiden title.
      </p>

      <p>
        {wikiLink("2011", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Formula_One_World_Championship")} was a challenging year for Hamilton, marking the first season he had been out-scored by a teammate, as {wikiLink("Button", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenson_Button")} finished runner-up to {wikiLink("Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")}. Setbacks in his private life, as well as on-track collisions culminating in multiple run-ins with the stewards, contributed to his inconsistent performances throughout the season. Hamilton finished fifth in the standings with three race wins; he secured the only non-Red Bull pole position of the season at the {wikiLink("Korean Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Korean_Grand_Prix")}, and vowed he would return to form.

Akin to the 2010 season, he endured a challenging latter half of the season, with inconsistent results and a series of mechanical failures. Across those ten races, Hamilton encountered five retirements, three whilst leading. Ultimately, Hamilton finished fourth in the standings, achieving four race wins and a season-highest seven pole positions. {wikiLink("Motorsport.com", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport.com")} analysis found that Hamilton had lost an estimated 110 points due to race retirements and other misfortunes. Prior to the end of the year, having denied multiple renegotiations with McLaren, Hamilton announced—to widespread surprise—that he would be joining {wikiLink("Mercedes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One")} for the 2013 season. Hamilton expressed his gratitude, stating he was "forever grateful" for the opportunities and support he had received throughout his career, ending a 15-year association with McLaren.

The move was met with surprise by pundits and the public, with some describing the move to Mercedes—a team with no recent history of success—as a gamble. In his first season with the {wikiLink("Brackley", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brackley")}-based team—amidst {wikiLink("Mercedes W04", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_F1_W04")}'s tyre management struggles—Hamilton finished fourth in the standings, securing five podium finishes and pole positions, with only one converted into a race victory at the {wikiLink("2013 Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}. Whilst {wikiLink("Pirelli", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirelli")}'s switch in tyre construction contributed to his victory in Hungary, Hamilton and Mercedes endured a difficult latter half of the season, as he only managed to achieve one podium finish for the rest of the year.

Mercedes won 16 of the 19 races held that season; Hamilton secured a career-best 11 victories as he prevailed in a season-long duel for the title against teammate Rosberg. After securing a streak of wins and acquiring the championship lead, Hamilton endured a number of misfortunes mid-season, including mechanical failures and a collision with Rosberg which culminated in a retirement from the {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}, saw him trailing Rosberg by 29 points in the standings. Following a run of five consecutive race victories towards the end of the season, Hamilton clinched his second World Drivers' Championship at the final round in {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}, and declared it was "the greatest day of [his] life" over team radio.
      </p>

      <p>
        Opting to continue racing with his old karting number 44, Hamilton fended off Rosberg's challenge for the title for a second year running in {wikiLink("2015", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, winning 10 races from a {wikiLink("then-joint record", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_driver_records#Most_podium_finishes_in_a_season")} 17 podium finishes, scoring 11 pole positions in the first 12 races, and leading the championship throughout the season, he achieved his first back-to-back championships. {wikiLink("His rivalry with Rosberg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton–Rosberg_rivalry")} intensified, climaxing in a heated battle at the {wikiLink("United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_United_States_Grand_Prix")}, where Hamilton clinched the title with three races to spare. Hamilton extended his contract with Mercedes for three additional years in a deal reportedly worth more than £100 million; the deal allowed Hamilton to retain his own image rights and keep his championship-winning cars and trophies.

        He endured a challenging start to the season, as a succession of poor race-starts and mechanical failures culminated in him being marginally behind Rosberg in the standings.

        In {wikiLink("2018", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, whilst {wikiLink("Ferrari", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari")} once again held the upper hand, Hamilton and {wikiLink("Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")} engaged in a much closer battle for their fifth title—widely billed as the "Fight for Five"—they exchanged the championship lead several times until the half-way point of the season. Beginning from the {wikiLink("German Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_German_Grand_Prix")}—where Vettel made an error while leading and retired, and Hamilton won starting from 14th on the grid—Vettel's season unravelled with a number of driver errors in the following races. Meanwhile, Hamilton repeated his run of consecutive wins to clinch his fifth title at the {wikiLink("Mexican Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Mexican_Grand_Prix")} for a second year running.

      <p>
        Securing a total of 11 {wikiLink("pole positions", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_polesitters")} and race victories from 17 {wikiLink("podium finishes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podium_finish")}, he set a new record for {wikiLink("most points scored in a season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_driver_records#Most_championship_points_in_a_season")} (408). During the season, Hamilton signed a two-year contract extension with {wikiLink("Mercedes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One")}, reported to be worth up to £40 million per year, making him the best-paid Formula One driver in history.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hamilton led the championship standings for the majority of {wikiLink("2019", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, whilst benefitting from {wikiLink("Mercedes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One")}' dominant performances during the first half of the season. He fended off title challenges from teammate {wikiLink("Valtteri Bottas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas")}, and remained unchallenged amidst {wikiLink("Ferrari", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari")}'s sturdy performances following the summer break. Hamilton clinched his sixth title at the {wikiLink("United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_United_States_Grand_Prix")} with two races remaining. After scoring his sixth career {wikiLink("grand slam", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(Formula_One)")} at the {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}, the season finale, Hamilton ended the season with 11 race wins and 17 podiums—matching the all-time record for a fourth time—and broke his own record for most points in a season with 413, finishing 87 points ahead of Bottas.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hamilton dominated the {wikiLink("2020", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Formula_One_World_Championship")} season to win his seventh Drivers' title, equalling {wikiLink("Michael Schumacher", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schumacher")}'s all-time record, in a season heavily impacted by the {wikiLink("COVID-19 pandemic", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic")}. Across the shortened 17-race calendar, Hamilton secured 10 pole positions and 11 race victories—including the {wikiLink("Portuguese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Portuguese_Grand_Prix")}, where he broke the record for most wins in Formula One history with his 92nd career victory. Hamilton missed the {wikiLink("Sakhir Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Sakhir_Grand_Prix")} after testing positive for COVID-19, marking his first missed race since his debut. He clinched the title with three races to spare at the rain-affected {wikiLink("Turkish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Turkish_Grand_Prix")}, and ended the season 124 points clear of Bottas.

        Regulation changes for the {wikiLink("2021", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Formula_One_World_Championship")} season saw {wikiLink("Red Bull", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing")} make performance gains on {wikiLink("Mercedes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One")}, winning five consecutive races and acquiring the championship lead. {wikiLink("Max Verstappen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen")} and Hamilton emerged as title favourites early on. Amidst their intense battle, the pair engaged in several on-track duels—culminating in collisions at {wikiLink("Britain", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_British_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("Italy", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Italian_Grand_Prix")}, and {wikiLink("Saudi Arabia", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")}—and finished 1–2 at 14 of 22 Grands Prix.
        Hamilton achieved his 100th {wikiLink("pole position", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_polesitters")} and race win at the {wikiLink("Spanish", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Spanish_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Russian Grands Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Russian_Grand_Prix")}, becoming the first driver to achieve either feat. A hat-trick of wins in the penultimate rounds—including a recovery drive at the {wikiLink("São Paulo Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix")}—eliminated a 19-point deficit to Verstappen ahead of the season-ending {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}. 
        Having led most of the race, Hamilton was denied the title by a last-lap overtake from Verstappen following a late safety car. During the year, he extended his £40 million per year contract with Mercedes by two additional years.
      </p>

      <p>
        The season finale was marred by controversy over race director {wikiLink("Michael Masi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Masi")}'s decision to instruct the lapped cars separating Verstappen and Hamilton to un-lap themselves under the safety car, which closed the gap between the pair and allowed Verstappen, who opted to pit for soft tyres, to enter the final lap immediately behind Hamilton, who remained on worn hard tyres. Four days after the race, the FIA announced that it would conduct an internal investigation into the incident. Masi was subsequently removed from his role as race director, with the {wikiLink("FIA World Motor Sport Council", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA_World_Motor_Sport_Council")} report finding that "human error" resulted in the failure to follow Formula One Sporting Regulations concerning the withdrawal of the safety car, adding that the final standings are "valid, final and cannot now be changed". Notwithstanding the controversy in Abu Dhabi, <i>{wikiLink("BBC Sport", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport")}'</i>s Andrew Benson described the season as "one of the most intense, hard-fought battles in sporting history", with Hamilton and Verstappen having "been head and shoulders—and a lot more—clear of every other driver on the grid".

Significant changes in technical regulations saw Hamilton and Mercedes endure a challenging campaign, as the innovative and radically different {wikiLink("W13", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_W13")} car suffered with {wikiLink("porpoising", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porpoising")} throughout the season, leading him to deem it "undrivable" and causing him to sustain a back injury at the {wikiLink("Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}. He frequently experimented with car setups to aid the W13's development during the opening stages of the season. Following major mid-season car upgrades, Hamilton achieved several podium finishes. Hamilton set several records across his sixteenth season, including most consecutive seasons with a podium finish, and at least one lap led. The season also marked the first time Hamilton finished behind his teammate in the standings since 2016, finishing sixth, 35 points behind Russell in fourth.

        Mercedes once again faced concerns over their car's competitiveness ahead of the {wikiLink("2023", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Formula_One_World_Championship")} season. Hamilton endured another winless campaign amidst {wikiLink("Red Bull", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing")} dominance, securing several podium finishes throughout and finishing third in the standings. He took his record ninth pole at the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}—his first since 2021—surpassing {wikiLink("Ayrton Senna", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrton_Senna")} and {wikiLink("Michael Schumacher", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schumacher")} for the {wikiLink("most pole positions at the same Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_driver_records#Most_pole_positions_at_the_same_Grand_Prix")}. Hamilton signed a two-year contract extension worth over {wikiLink("£100 million", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling")} to remain with Mercedes.

        Prior to the start of the {wikiLink("2024", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Formula_One_World_Championship")} season, Hamilton triggered an exit-clause in his contract, allowing him to leave Mercedes at the end of his campaign, a year before his contract was due to expire. Having been associated with the German marque since the age of 13, Hamilton explained the decision was one of his hardest to make, adding that he needed a new challenge and a different work environment. Mercedes' inconsistent form, coupled with Hamilton's difficulties in adapting to the {wikiLink("W15", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_W15")} car—whose characteristics struggled to mesh with his driving style—led to inconsistent qualifying performances, resulting in another challenging season in 2024. Mercedes' short-lived resurgence during mid-season enabled him to deliver his ninth {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_British_Grand_Prix")} victory, ending his 31-month winless drought; he broke the record for {wikiLink("most wins at the same Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_driver_records#Most_wins_at_the_same_Grand_Prix")} and became the first driver to win beyond their 300th start. Hamilton secured his 200th podium finish in {wikiLink("Hungary", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}, and another victory at the {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}. After a series of races with fluctuating results, admitting he was "looking forward to the end [of the season]", Hamilton ended the season a career-lowest seventh in the championship—22 points behind teammate Russell—marking the end of his Mercedes career, which was the most successful driver-constructor partnership in Formula One history by several metrics.

        Following the announcement of his departure from Mercedes, {wikiLink("Ferrari", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari")} announced they had reached a multi-year agreement with Hamilton to join the team in {wikiLink("2025", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, on a contract reported to be worth more than £40 million per year, replacing {wikiLink("Carlos Sainz Jr.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr.")} to partner {wikiLink("Charles Leclerc", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc")}. Hamilton stated it had been a "childhood dream" to drive for Ferrari. In parallel to his move from McLaren to Mercedes in 2013, it was noted as one of the most unexpected driver transfers in Formula One history, and marked the first time in his career where he did not drive for a {wikiLink("Mercedes-powered", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_AMG_High_Performance_Powertrains")} team. He finished tenth on debut at the {wikiLink("2025 Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Australian_Grand_Prix")} after a strategic error.
