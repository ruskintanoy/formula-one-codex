      <p>
        Hamilton began {wikiLink("karting", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karting")} in 1993 and quickly began winning races and cadet class championships. Two years later, he became the youngest driver to win the {wikiLink("British cadet karting championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Cadet_Karting_Championship")} at the age of ten. That year, Hamilton approached {wikiLink("Ron Dennis", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Dennis")} at the {wikiLink("Autosport Awards", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosport_Awards")} for an autograph and said: "Hi. I'm Lewis Hamilton. I won the British Championship and one day I want to be racing your cars." Dennis wrote in Hamilton's autograph book: "Phone me in nine years, we'll sort something out then."
      </p>

      <p>
        When Hamilton was 12, {wikiLink("Ladbrokes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladbrokes")} took a bet, at 40/1 odds, that Hamilton would win a {wikiLink("Formula One", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One")} race before the age of 23; another predicted, at 150/1 odds, that he would win the {wikiLink("World Drivers' Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_World_Champions")} before he was 25. In 1998, Dennis called Hamilton following his second {wikiLink("Super One series", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_1_National_Kart_Championship")} and British championship wins, to offer Hamilton a role in the {wikiLink("McLaren-Mercedes Young Driver Programme", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_Young_Driver_Programme")}. The contract included an option of a future Formula One seat, which would make Hamilton the youngest driver to secure a contract that later resulted in a Formula One drive.

      Hamilton continued his progress in the {wikiLink("Intercontinental A", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_A")} (1999), Formula A (2000) and Formula Super A (2001) ranks, and became European Champion in 2000 with maximum points. In {wikiLink("Formula A", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KF1")} and Formula Super A, racing for TeamMBM.com, his teammate was {wikiLink("Nico Rosberg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Rosberg")}, who would later drive for the {wikiLink("Williams", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Grand_Prix_Engineering")} and {wikiLink("Mercedes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One")} teams in Formula One; they would later team up again for Mercedes from 2013 to 2016. Following his karting successes, the {wikiLink("British Racing Drivers' Club", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Racing_Drivers%27_Club")} made him a "Rising Star" Member in 2000. In 2001, {wikiLink("Michael Schumacher", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schumacher")} made a one-off return to karts and competed against Hamilton along with other future Formula One drivers {wikiLink("Vitantonio Liuzzi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitantonio_Liuzzi")} and {wikiLink("Nico Rosberg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Rosberg")}. Hamilton ended the final in seventh, four places behind Schumacher. Although the two saw little of each other on the track, Schumacher praised the young Briton.

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-red-600 mb-2">Formula Renault and Formula Three</h3>

    <p>
      Hamilton began his car racing career in the {wikiLink("2001 British Formula Renault Winter Series", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_British_Formula_Renault_Winter_Series")}, finishing fifth in the standings. This led to a full {wikiLink("2002 Formula Renault UK", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Formula_Renault_2.0_UK_Championship")} campaign with {wikiLink("Manor Motorsport", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manor_Motorsport")}, in which he finished third overall, and fifth in the {wikiLink("Formula Renault Eurocup", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Formula_Renault_2000_Eurocup")} despite only competing in four rounds. He remained with Manor for {wikiLink("another year", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Formula_Renault_2.0_UK_Championship")} in Formula Renault UK, winning the championship in dominant fashion ahead of {wikiLink("Alex Lloyd", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Lloyd_(racing_driver)")} with 10 wins from 15 races. Having clinched the championship, Hamilton missed the last two races of the season to debut in the {wikiLink("British Formula 3 Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Formula_3_Championship")} finale. In his first race he retired with a puncture, and in the second he crashed out after colliding with teammate {wikiLink("Tor Graves", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_Graves")}, requiring hospital treatment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Asked in 2002 about becoming one of the youngest ever Formula One drivers, Hamilton stated his goal was "not to be the youngest in Formula One" but rather "to be experienced and then show what I can do in Formula One". He made his full-season debut with Manor in the {wikiLink("2004 Formula 3 Euro Series", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Formula_3_Euro_Series")}, finishing fifth in the championship. He also won the {wikiLink("Bahrain F3 Superprix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain_F3_Superprix")} and competed twice in the {wikiLink("Macau F3 Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau_Grand_Prix")}. {wikiLink("Williams", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Grand_Prix_Engineering")} nearly signed Hamilton, but their engine supplier {wikiLink("BMW", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_in_Formula_One")} declined to fund the deal. Hamilton eventually re-signed with McLaren after a dispute between his father Anthony and McLaren executive {wikiLink("Martin Whitmarsh", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Whitmarsh")}. Following a "huge row" over Hamilton moving to GP2 versus remaining in Formula 3, Whitmarsh tore up his contract. Six weeks later, Hamilton called Whitmarsh and rejoined the McLaren programme.
