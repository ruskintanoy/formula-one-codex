        {wikiLink("2021 British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_British_Grand_Prix")}, having started 16th and benefited from a late pit stop from{" "}

      </p>

      <p>
        Tsunoda qualified 15th at the{" "}
        {wikiLink("2021 Dutch Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Dutch_Grand_Prix")}, but he would fail to finish the race as he retired in the pits with a power unit issue.[104][105] At the following race, the{" "}
        {wikiLink("2021 Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Italian_Grand_Prix")}, he collided with{" "}
        {wikiLink("Robert Kubica", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kubica")} in sprint qualifying and then failed to start the race due to brake issues.[106][107] In the next seven Grands Prix, Tsunoda advanced to Q3 all but once. During the{" "}

        {wikiLink("2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")},[116][117] but failed to score points in either.[118] He apologised for his role in a collision with{" "}
        {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")} at the latter.[119] He qualified eighth in the final race of the season, the{" "}
        {wikiLink("2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}; notably, this was the first time all season that he outqualified teammate Gasly, who was eliminated in Q2.[120][121] From this position, Tsunoda finished fourth and gained 12 points, his best ever result.[122][123]
      </p>

      <p>
        Tsunoda placed 14th in the drivers' championship with 32 points to Gasly's 110.[124]

        Tsunoda and Gasly were retained by AlphaTauri for the {wikiLink("2022", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Formula_One_World_Championship")} season. At the season-opening {wikiLink("Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, Tsunoda qualified 16th and improved to eighth in the race to score four points. A fuel issue prevented him from setting a qualifying time at the {wikiLink("Saudi Arabian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")}; he then failed to start the race after a power unit failure. At the {wikiLink("Emilia Romagna Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix")}, Tsunoda qualified 16th, just ahead of Gasly, and finished 12th in the sprint. He made up places in the race and passed {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")} late on for seventh place. He described the race as the best of his Formula One career. His first Q3 appearance of the season came at the {wikiLink("Miami Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Miami_Grand_Prix")}, where he qualified ninth. However, an early pit stop and lack of pace meant that he would slip to 12th at the flag. He scored points for the third time in six races at the {wikiLink("Spanish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Spanish_Grand_Prix")}, finishing tenth, having started in 13th.
      </p>

      <p>
        A streak of twelve races without scoring points followed. Tsunoda hit the wall in qualifying for the {wikiLink("Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}, but managed to get into Q2 and qualify 11th. However, he finished the race 17th. Tsunoda qualified a brilliant eighth at the {wikiLink("Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}. He was running in seventh place until he was forced to pit for repairs after a {wikiLink("DRS", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_reduction_system")} failure, which led him to finish down in a disappointing 13th place. After starting from the back due to an engine penalty, he crashed whilst exiting the pits at the {wikiLink("Canadian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Canadian_Grand_Prix")}. He had further woes at the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_British_Grand_Prix")}, first breaking his front wing during the lap 1 chaos and later collided with Gasly on lap 10. Tsunoda finished 13th, later apologised as he ended in 14th place. He qualified eighth for the {wikiLink("French Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_French_Grand_Prix")}. However, a first-lap collision with {wikiLink("Esteban Ocon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon")} resulted in Tsunoda's eventual retirement after a few laps. Having qualified 16th for the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}, Tsunoda would struggle in the race, on route to 19th place, two laps down.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}, Tsunoda started from the pit lane but managed to charge to 13th place. At the {wikiLink("Dutch Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Dutch_Grand_Prix")}, Tsunoda started ninth, but retired with a {wikiLink("differential", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)")} issue. He had stopped at the side of the track and loosened his seatbelts before driving back to the pits, for which he was given his fifth reprimand of the season and therefore a grid penalty for the {wikiLink("Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Italian_Grand_Prix")}. At that event, he received two penalty points and another grid penalty for failing to slow for {wikiLink("yellow flags", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_flags#Yellow_flag")} in practice. He finished 14th. At the {wikiLink("Singapore Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Singapore_Grand_Prix")}, Tsunoda qualified tenth. He would lose two places after a slight mistake, before crashing out of the race on his own on lap 35. At his first home race during the {wikiLink("Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}, Tsunoda finished the race in 13th place, ahead of teammate Gasly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tsunoda scored a point at the {wikiLink("United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_Grand_Prix")} where he started 19th, gained five places on the first lap and finished 10th. This ended his long streak of not scoring points. He was running 11th at the {wikiLink("Mexico City Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Mexico_City_Grand_Prix")} but was eliminated in a collision with {wikiLink("Daniel Ricciardo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo")}. At the {wikiLink("São Paulo Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix")}, an unusual glitch in the safety car system meant that Tsunoda drove to 17th place, the only driver who was lapped during the race. At the final race in {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}, Tsunoda missed out on points with 11th place.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tsunoda ended the season 17th in the drivers' championship with 12 points to Gasly's 23.

        Tsunoda remained with {wikiLink("AlphaTauri", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_AlphaTauri")} for the {wikiLink("2023 season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, partnering rookie {wikiLink("Nyck de Vries", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyck_de_Vries")} as {wikiLink("Gasly", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gasly")} left for {wikiLink("Alpine", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team")}. Tsunoda finished 11th at the {wikiLink("Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}; he had a poor start to the race and finished just over one second behind {wikiLink("Alex Albon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Albon")}. At the {wikiLink("Saudi Arabian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")}, a safety car allowed Tsunoda to make his pit stop and jump up to eighth place. He was later passed by the two {wikiLink("Alpine", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team")} cars and then by {wikiLink("Kevin Magnussen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen")} with five laps remaining, finishing 11th for the third race in succession. At the {wikiLink("Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, Tsunoda qualified 12th and ran as high as fifth when the race restarted after the second red flag, but was demoted to 11th when the order was reset after the third stoppage. A penalty for {wikiLink("Carlos Sainz Jr.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr.")} promoted him to tenth, earning his and AlphaTauri's first point of the year. Following the opening races, Tsunoda was praised for his performances.
      </p>

      <p>
        He reached Q3 for the first time in 2023 at the {wikiLink("Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}. Contact with teammate {wikiLink("De Vries", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyck_de_Vries")} in the sprint caused him to hit a wall and eventually retire. He finished tenth in the race to score another point. At the {wikiLink("Miami Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Miami_Grand_Prix")} Tsunoda again finished 11th, closely behind {wikiLink("Kevin Magnussen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen")}, after starting 17th. In the {wikiLink("Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Monaco_Grand_Prix")} he advanced to Q3 and was running ninth when he developed brake issues, eventually dropping to 15th. He finished ninth at the {wikiLink("Spanish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Spanish_Grand_Prix")} but received a penalty for forcing {wikiLink("Zhou Guanyu", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Guanyu")} off the track, dropping him outside the points. Tsunoda later described the penalty as "ridiculous" and accused Zhou of pretending to be forced off. At the {wikiLink("Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Austrian_Grand_Prix")}, his front wing broke in a collision with {wikiLink("Esteban Ocon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon")} and he received multiple penalties post-race for track limits infringements.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}, Tsunoda was partnered with {wikiLink("Daniel Ricciardo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo")} after {wikiLink("De Vries", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyck_de_Vries")} was dropped by the team. He finished the race 15th, two places behind Ricciardo. He ran as high as sixth during the early laps of the {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Belgian_Grand_Prix")} and finished tenth, scoring his first points since April. Tsunoda was joined at AlphaTauri by {wikiLink("Liam Lawson", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Lawson")} from the {wikiLink("Dutch Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Dutch_Grand_Prix")} onwards after Ricciardo broke his hand. He ended the race behind Lawson in 15th place, having run well in the top 10 during the early stages in a dry-wet race. Tsunoda qualified 11th at the {wikiLink("Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Italian_Grand_Prix")} but failed to take the start as his engine failed during the {wikiLink("formation lap", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_lap")}. He was then eliminated on lap one of the {wikiLink("Singapore Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Singapore_Grand_Prix")} with damage from a collision with {wikiLink("Sergio Pérez", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P%C3%A9rez")}. Tsunoda made it to Q3 and qualified ninth at his home race during the {wikiLink("Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}, much to the delight of the Japanese fans. However, he went backwards on race day as he fell out of the points to 12th place at the end, finishing behind teammate Lawson.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the {wikiLink("United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_United_States_Grand_Prix")}, Tsunoda benefitted a position to tenth place after {wikiLink("Fernando Alonso", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso")} retired, and then pitted late on to set his first fastest lap. Having scored his first points since the summer break, this was further aided after {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")} and {wikiLink("Charles Leclerc", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc")} were disqualified, promoting Tsunoda to eighth. He started from the back at the {wikiLink("Mexico City Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Mexico_City_Grand_Prix")} after taking additional power unit elements. After surprisingly making his points midway through the race, his charge halted when he was tagged in a spin by {wikiLink("Oscar Piastri", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri")}, and was left to rue what could have been in 12th. In {wikiLink("Brazil", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix")}, Tsunoda was knocked off Q1 in 16th. However, in the sprint, his pace was much more promising, finishing sixth after an overtake on Hamilton. In the race, Tsunoda advanced to tenth early on at the start, but despite a tiny mistake, he was able to secure ninth place. At the season-ending {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}, Tsunoda qualified in a career-best sixth. Having tried an ambitious one-stop strategy, he led a race for the first time ever. It would not pay off as he hoped, holding off Hamilton for eighth place. Despite being unable to help AlphaTauri overhaul {wikiLink("Williams", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Racing")} for P7 in the constructors, he earned Driver Of The Day in the season finale.

      <p>
        Tsunoda finished the 2023 season 14th in the standings, with 17 points.

        {wikiLink("AlphaTauri", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Formula_One_Team")}, which was renamed to {wikiLink("RB Formula One Team", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Formula_One_Team")} for the {wikiLink("2024 season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, retained Tsunoda and {wikiLink("Daniel Ricciardo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo")}. At the season-opening {wikiLink("Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, starting 11th, Tsunoda was battling {wikiLink("Kevin Magnussen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen")} for 12th but was ordered to allow teammate Ricciardo through, in which he expressed his frustration. He crossed the line in 14th, and later divebombed Ricciardo on the cooldown lap to vent further irritation. At the {wikiLink("Saudi Arabian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")}, Tsunoda achieved his first Q3 of the year qualifying ninth, but he would slip back on race day, being once again embroiled in a battle with Magnussen to eventually finish 15th. He qualified eighth in {wikiLink("Australia", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Australian_Grand_Prix")}. Nailing his strategy, he crossed the line in seventh place, once again being praised for making "big steps" whilst scoring his first points of 2024. Tsunoda made it to Q3 again for his home {wikiLink("Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}. Despite being stuck in the midfield mid-race, a superb second pit stop allowed him to jump his rivals and finish tenth, becoming the first Japanese driver to score points on home soil since {wikiLink("2012", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}.

        An unlucky {wikiLink("Chinese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Chinese_Grand_Prix")} followed, as Tsunoda was tipped into a spin by Magnussen following a safety car restart, which caused the former to retire. The sprint at the {wikiLink("Miami Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Miami_Grand_Prix")} saw Tsunoda finish eighth, securing a point. He followed it up with another seventh place in the main race, even finishing in front of {wikiLink("Mercedes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One")}' {wikiLink("George Russell", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)")} . More points finishes followed from his Q3 appearances, placing tenth and eighth at the {wikiLink("Emilia Romagna", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Monaco Grands Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Monaco_Grand_Prix")} respectively. He continued his strong qualifying performances with eighth in {wikiLink("Canada", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Canadian_Grand_Prix")}. Having run close to teammate Ricciardo, he spun towards the conclusion of the race, leading him to finish in 14th. Struggles followed where Tsunoda failed to score points at the {wikiLink("Spanish", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Spanish_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Austrian Grand Prixs", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Austrian_Grand_Prix")}, despite RB introducing upgrades. Starting from 13th at the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_British_Grand_Prix")}, Tsunoda took advantage of the inclement weather and secured tenth place, then he backed that result up by finishing ninth at the next race in {wikiLink("Hungary", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")} despite a big crash in Q3. He was hit with an engine penalty that confined him to the back of the grid at the {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}, and struggled with pace to only finish 16th.

      <p>
        A tough outing at the {wikiLink("Dutch Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Dutch_Grand_Prix")} followed starting 12th, where a wrong pit strategy would soon unravel his race and he eventually finished down in 17th. This was followed by back-to-back retirements at the {wikiLink("Italian", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Italian_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Azerbaijan Grand Prixs", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}, owing to collisions by {wikiLink("Nico Hülkenberg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_H%C3%BClkenberg")} and {wikiLink("Lance Stroll", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Stroll")} through no fault of his own. Starting from the {wikiLink("United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_Grand_Prix")}, Tsunoda would be partnered by {wikiLink("Liam Lawson", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Lawson")} as he replaced Ricciardo. Qualifying 11th for the race, it would be scruffy for him, being jumped by Lawson in the pitstops and later spinning on his own, eventually finishing in 14th place. A frustrating weekend in {wikiLink("Mexico City Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Mexico_City_Grand_Prix")} followed, crashing out in qualifying and being taken out by colliding rearwards on the opening lap by {wikiLink("Alex Albon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Albon")}. Tsunoda got his best qualifying position to date at the {wikiLink("São Paulo Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix")}, securing third in a rain-hit session. Driving a solid race early on, Tsunoda pitted for wet tyres and was making up ground rapidly but lost out to a red flag brought out by {wikiLink("Franco Colapinto", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_Colapinto")}, where drivers could make a free pit stop. He eventually finished in seventh place, benefitting a position from {wikiLink("Oscar Piastri", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri")}'s penalty.

        The week before the {wikiLink("Las Vegas Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Las_Vegas_Grand_Prix")}, Tsunoda was interrogated by {wikiLink("U.S. Customs and Border Protection", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection")} officers at {wikiLink("Harry Reid International Airport", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Reid_International_Airport")} for several hours whilst attempting to enter the country. He qualified ninth in {wikiLink("Las Vegas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Las_Vegas_Grand_Prix")}, finishing in the same position after a battle with {wikiLink("Nico Hülkenberg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_H%C3%BClkenberg")}. At the {wikiLink("Qatar Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Qatar_Grand_Prix")}, Tsunoda finished 16th in the sprint and 13th in the Grand Prix, on a weekend where RB lacked pace. Starting 11th for the {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}, Tsunoda suffered an anti-stall during the start where he dropped to the back, and could not recover much from there as he finished 12th.

      <p>
        Tsunoda finished the season 12th in the drivers' championship with 30 points, his highest ever placing in Formula 1 to date.

        <p>
          Tsunoda extended his contract with {wikiLink("Racing Bulls", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_Bulls")} for his {wikiLink("2025", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Formula_One_World_Championship")} campaign, partnering {wikiLink("FIA Formula 2", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Formula_2_Championship")} runner-up {wikiLink("Isack Hadjar", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isack_Hadjar")}. After his early-season performances at the {wikiLink("Australian", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Australian_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Chinese", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Chinese_Grand_Prix")} Grands Prix—including sixth at the latter sprint—{wikiLink("Red Bull", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing")} opened discussions to promote Tsunoda as a replacement for {wikiLink("Liam Lawson", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Lawson")} at the parent team. He had qualified fifth and ninth, respectively, before being denied points finishes due to strategic errors at both, as well as spontaneous {wikiLink("front wing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downforce")} damage in China.
