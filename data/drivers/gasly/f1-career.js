      <p>
        In December 2013 it was announced that Gasly would be inducted into the {wikiLink("Red Bull Junior Team", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Junior_Team")} for the {wikiLink("2014 Formula One season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Formula_One_season")} alongside future GP2 Series teammate {wikiLink("Alex Lynn", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Lynn")} and future {wikiLink("Scuderia Toro Rosso", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Toro_Rosso")} teammate {wikiLink("Carlos Sainz Jr.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr.")}. Gasly's first experience in Formula One machinery came in May 2015 at the in-season test at the {wikiLink("Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_Barcelona-Catalunya")}. He drove the {wikiLink("Toro Rosso STR10", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toro_Rosso_STR10")} on the first day of the test and the {wikiLink("Red Bull RB11", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_RB11")} on the second day, recording 203 laps in total. He later tested the RB11 again at the {wikiLink("Red Bull Ring", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Ring")} in June and was officially named {wikiLink("Red Bull Racing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing")}'s reserve driver in September. Gasly continued testing for Red Bull and Toro Rosso during the {wikiLink("2016", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Formula_One_World_Championship")} and {wikiLink("2017", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Formula_One_World_Championship")} seasons.

        Gasly made his Formula One race debut at the {wikiLink("2017 Malaysian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Malaysian_Grand_Prix")} with {wikiLink("Toro Rosso", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toro_Rosso")}, replacing {wikiLink("Daniil Kvyat", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Kvyat")}. He finished the Malaysian and {wikiLink("Japanese", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Japanese_Grand_Prix")} Grands Prix outside the points. Gasly was expected to take Carlos Sainz Jr.'s seat at the {wikiLink("2017 United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_States_Grand_Prix")} after Sainz left for {wikiLink("Renault", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_in_F1")}, but he was forced to miss the race due to a clash with the final round of the {wikiLink("2017 Super Formula Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Super_Formula_Championship")}. He returned to the team for the {wikiLink("2017 Mexican Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Mexican_Grand_Prix")}, partnering with {wikiLink("Brendon Hartley", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendon_Hartley")} after the team decided to drop Kvyat from the Red Bull programme.

        Gasly and Hartley became full-time Toro Rosso drivers for the {wikiLink("2018", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Formula_One_World_Championship")} season. At the {wikiLink("2018 Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, Gasly qualified sixth but was promoted to fifth on the grid after a penalty for {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")}. He finished the race in fourth place after {wikiLink("Kimi Räikkönen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimi_R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen")} retired, earning his first points finish in Formula One. A week later in {wikiLink("China", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Chinese_Grand_Prix")}, he crashed into teammate Hartley in what the two confessed as being a 'miscommunication'. Gasly recorded four more points finishes during the season, including seventh place at {wikiLink("Monaco", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Monaco_Grand_Prix")} and sixth place at {wikiLink("Hungary", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}.

        Gasly was contracted to drive for {wikiLink("Red Bull Racing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing")} for the {wikiLink("2019", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Formula_One_World_Championship")} season, partnering {wikiLink("Max Verstappen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen")} following the departure of {wikiLink("Daniel Ricciardo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo")} to Renault. Gasly qualified seventeenth at his first race with the team, the {wikiLink("2019 Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Australian_Grand_Prix")} and failed to score in the race. He again failed to qualify in the top ten at the following {wikiLink("2019 Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, and retired from sixth place with a driveshaft issue at the {wikiLink("2019 Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}. He scored points at the following six races but finished a lap behind the leaders at the {wikiLink("2019 Canadian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Canadian_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("2019 French Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_French_Grand_Prix")}, and {wikiLink("2019 Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Austrian_Grand_Prix")}, the latter of which was won by Verstappen. His best result with Red Bull Racing came at the {wikiLink("2019 British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_British_Grand_Prix")} where he finished fourth after Verstappen and {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")} collided ahead. At the {wikiLink("2019 German Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_German_Grand_Prix")}, Gasly retired after colliding with {wikiLink("Alex Albon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Albon")}'s Toro Rosso in an attempt to overtake for sixth place.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gasly came under increasing pressure at the {wikiLink("2019 Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}, where he finished sixth having been lapped by Verstappen. Despite Gasly's poor results, Red Bull team principal {wikiLink("Christian Horner", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner")} and advisor {wikiLink("Helmut Marko", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Marko")} stated that the team intended to keep Gasly until the end of the season. At this stage of the season, Gasly was sixth in the drivers' championship with 63 points. Verstappen, meanwhile, had recorded 181 points, two race wins, five podium finishes, and one pole position.

        Ahead of the {wikiLink("2019 Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}, Gasly was demoted back to junior team Toro Rosso with {wikiLink("Alex Albon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Albon")} taking his place at Red Bull. Red Bull stated that the swap was made in order to "make an informed decision as to who will drive alongside Max [Verstappen] in 2020", with Horner remarking that "we desperately need [Gasly] realising more of the potential of the car."

      <p>
        During the remainder of the season at Toro Rosso, partnering with {wikiLink("Daniil Kvyat", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Kvyat")}, Gasly achieved five points finishes, including ninth place at his first race back at the team at the {wikiLink("2019 Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}. His best result came at the {wikiLink("2019 Brazilian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Brazilian_Grand_Prix")}, where he qualified in seventh place and took advantage of retirements from {wikiLink("Valtteri Bottas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas")} and both {wikiLink("Ferrari", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari")} drivers, as well as a collision between {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")} and {wikiLink("Alex Albon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Albon")}, to finish the race in second place after holding off Hamilton in a straight drag to the finish line. This marked the first podium finish of Gasly's Formula One career, Toro Rosso's best race result since the {wikiLink("2008 Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Italian_Grand_Prix")}, and {wikiLink("Honda", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_in_Formula_One")}'s first 1–2 finish since the {wikiLink("1991 Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}. On his cool-down lap, Gasly remarked over the radio: "This is the best day of my life". He ended the season seventh in the drivers' championship with 95 points; during his nine races back at Toro Rosso, he scored 32 points compared to 10 for teammate Kvyat in the same period.

        Gasly was retained by the team, along with Kvyat, as they rebranded to {wikiLink("Scuderia AlphaTauri", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_AlphaTauri")}. Gasly achieved four points finishes in the first seven races of the season, with best results of seventh place at the {wikiLink("2020 Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Austrian_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("2020 British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_British_Grand_Prix")} Grands Prix.

      <p>
        At the {wikiLink("2020 Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Italian_Grand_Prix")}, an early pit stop allowed Gasly to pass several drivers – who had to wait for the pitlane to open during a safety car procedure – promoting him to third place. As race leader Hamilton entered the pits to serve a penalty and second-placed driver {wikiLink("Lance Stroll", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Stroll")} lost places at the restart, Gasly inherited the lead of the race and held off the late-charging Carlos Sainz Jr. to take his first win in Formula One, becoming the 109th different race winner and the first French driver to win a Grand Prix since {wikiLink("Olivier Panis", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Panis")}' victory at the {wikiLink("1996 Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}, 24 years prior. This prompted speculation that Gasly could return to Red Bull, as his replacement, Alex Albon, finished only fifteenth. Gasly remarked that he was 'ready' to do so. AlphaTauri team principal {wikiLink("Franz Tost", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Tost")} praised Gasly's race but dismissed the possibility of Gasly returning to Red Bull in the near future.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gasly was eliminated in a first-lap collision at the following race, the {wikiLink("2020 Tuscan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Tuscan_Grand_Prix")}. He scored points at the next three races, including fifth place at the {wikiLink("2020 Portuguese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Portuguese_Grand_Prix")}, but retired with a coolant leak at the {wikiLink("2020 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix")} having qualified a season-best fourth. He finished the 2020 season tenth in the drivers' championship with 75 points, ahead of teammate Kvyat's 32 points.

Gasly's points streak ended at the {wikiLink("2021 Styrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Styrian_Grand_Prix")} when he was eliminated by a first-lap collision with Leclerc. A late-race puncture at the {wikiLink("2021 British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_British_Grand_Prix")} dropped Gasly out of the points positions.

      <p>
        At the {wikiLink("2021 Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Italian_Grand_Prix")}, Gasly crashed out in sprint qualifying after he made contact with Daniel Ricciardo, wedging his front wing underneath his wheels.

Gasly finished the season ninth in the drivers' standings with his highest ever points tally in a single season, scoring 110 points to teammate Tsunoda's 32.

        Gasly continued to race for AlphaTauri in {wikiLink("2022", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Formula_One_World_Championship")} alongside Tsunoda. An engine fire caused his retirement from the season-opening {wikiLink("Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}. He scored points at the {wikiLink("Saudi Arabian", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Australian", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Australian_Grand_Prix")} Grands Prix, but failed to do so at the following four races, which included retirement from a collision with {wikiLink("Lando Norris", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris")} at the {wikiLink("Miami Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Miami_Grand_Prix")}. He ended the zero-point streak by finishing fifth at the {wikiLink("Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}. Five more races without points followed, including a collision with teammate Tsunoda that ended his race at the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_British_Grand_Prix")}. Gasly qualified tenth at the {wikiLink("Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Austrian_Grand_Prix")} but collided with Lewis Hamilton in the sprint and Sebastian Vettel in the race, finishing fifteenth.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was set to start the {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Belgian_Grand_Prix")} from eighth place, however an electrical issue shortly before the race forced him to start from the pit lane. He recovered to the points positions, finishing ninth. His final points of the season came at the {wikiLink("Italian", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Italian_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Singapore", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Singapore_Grand_Prix")} Grands Prix. Gasly had run in seventh place in Singapore, but complained that the team "threw away" this result by switching him to dry-weather tyres too early, dropping him to tenth. At the {wikiLink("Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}, Gasly criticised the deployment of a recovery tractor in wet conditions to extract Carlos Sainz Jr.'s crashed car, describing it as "disrespectful" to the memory of the late {wikiLink("Jules Bianchi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Bianchi")} and stating "I could have killed myself". He received a penalty for speeding under the subsequent {wikiLink("red flag", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_flags#Red_flag")} and was demoted to eighteenth place. Gasly ended the season fourteenth in the drivers' championship, scoring 23 points to Tsunoda's 12.

      <p>
        After the {wikiLink("Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")} in June, AlphaTauri team principal {wikiLink("Franz Tost", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Tost")} confirmed that Gasly had a contract with the team and would remain with them for {wikiLink("2023", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. In August and September, information emerged that {wikiLink("Alpine", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team")} were targeting Gasly after {wikiLink("Fernando Alonso", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso")} and {wikiLink("Oscar Piastri", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri")} both left the team, and that Red Bull were willing to release him. Gasly's move to Alpine for 2023 was officially announced in October.

        Gasly signed a multi-year contract to race for {wikiLink("Alpine", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team")} in {wikiLink("2023", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, partnering fellow Frenchman and former karting rival {wikiLink("Esteban Ocon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon")}. AlphaTauri allowed Gasly to join Alpine for the post-season testing immediately after the {wikiLink("2022 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}.
      </p>

      <p>
        In his first race with Alpine at the {wikiLink("2023 Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, Gasly started last after having his qualifying time deleted, but recovered to finish ninth in the race. Gasly was in fifth place when racing resumed after the second red flag at the {wikiLink("2023 Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, but collided with Ocon at the first {wikiLink("chicane", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicane")}, causing the retirement of both Alpine cars. His practice running at the {wikiLink("2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")} was curtailed by an engine fire. He later crashed in qualifying and failed to score points in the sprint or the main race. Gasly qualified in the top ten and scored points at the following three races; this included starting fifth on the grid at the {wikiLink("2023 Miami Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Miami_Grand_Prix")} and qualifying fourth at the {wikiLink("2023 Spanish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Spanish_Grand_Prix")}, before being demoted by two separate penalties for impeding.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gasly next scored a point at the {wikiLink("2023 Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Austrian_Grand_Prix")}, where he finished ninth but was dropped one position for track limits infringements. Two retirements from collisions followed; one with {wikiLink("Lance Stroll", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Stroll")} at the {wikiLink("2023 British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_British_Grand_Prix")} and a multi-car accident on the opening lap of the {wikiLink("2023 Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}. He qualified sixth for the {wikiLink("2023 Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Belgian_Grand_Prix")} sprint and an early switch to {wikiLink("intermediate tyres", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_tyre")} promoted him to third place, earning six points. He did not score in the main race, where he finished eleventh. His sprint podium was followed by a Grand Prix podium at the {wikiLink("2023 Dutch Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Dutch_Grand_Prix")}; he started twelfth and again benefited from an early stop for intermediate tyres. He crossed the finish line fourth but gained a place from {wikiLink("Sergio Pérez", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P%C3%A9rez")}'s penalty, earning his first podium in over two years. Gasly achieved four more points finishes before the end of the season, including sixth-place finishes at the {wikiLink("2023 Singapore Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Singapore_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("2023 United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_United_States_Grand_Prix")}. He started fourth at the {wikiLink("2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Las_Vegas_Grand_Prix")} but finished outside the points.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gasly ended his first season with Alpine eleventh in the World Drivers' Championship with 62 points, one place and four points ahead of teammate {wikiLink("Ocon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon")}.

        Gasly and Ocon remained at Alpine for {wikiLink("2024", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. They qualified in the bottom two positions for the {wikiLink("Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}. Ocon had commented after pre-season testing that the team were "on the back foot" and Gasly described the Bahrain result as "not a surprise". Both drivers were again eliminated in Q1 at the {wikiLink("Saudi Arabian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")}, and Gasly was forced into retirement on the first lap of the race with gearbox issues.
        Gasly finished no higher than 12th at the {wikiLink("Australian", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("Japanese", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("Chinese", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Chinese_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("Miami", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Miami_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Emilia Romagna", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix")} Grands Prix, failing to score points.
        He scored his first point of the season at the {wikiLink("Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}, then finished ninth at both the {wikiLink("Canadian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Canadian_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Spanish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Spanish_Grand_Prix")}, with another point at the {wikiLink("Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Austrian_Grand_Prix")}.
        Gasly retired at the {wikiLink("British", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_British_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Hungarian", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")} Grands Prix before returning to the points at the {wikiLink("Dutch Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Dutch_Grand_Prix")}.
        He endured a four-race pointless streak through {wikiLink("Italy", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Italian_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("Azerbaijan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("Singapore", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Singapore_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("United States", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_Grand_Prix")} Grands Prix.
        At the {wikiLink("Mexico City Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Mexico_City_Grand_Prix")}, he scored one point, before claiming a podium with third place at the {wikiLink("São Paulo Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix")}, his fifth in F1.
        He then qualified third at the {wikiLink("Las Vegas Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Las_Vegas_Grand_Prix")} but retired, before finishing fifth in {wikiLink("Qatar", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Qatar_Grand_Prix")} and seventh in {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}, securing 10th in the standings and helping Alpine beat Haas to 6th in the Constructors'.
