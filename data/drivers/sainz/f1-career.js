        Sainz became part of the {wikiLink("Red Bull Junior Team", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Junior_Team")} in 2010. His first experience in a Formula One car came at the young drivers' test at {wikiLink("Silverstone Circuit", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit")} in July 2013, where he drove both the {wikiLink("Toro Rosso STR8", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toro_Rosso_STR8")} and the {wikiLink("Red Bull RB9", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_RB9")}. Sainz confirmed that discussions had taken place with the struggling {wikiLink("Caterham", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterham_F1")} team for a race debut during the {wikiLink("2014", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Formula_One_World_Championship")} season but, ultimately, no agreement was reached. As a reward for his Formula Renault 3.5 Series title, Sainz drove the {wikiLink("Red Bull RB10", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_RB10")} in the post-season test after the {wikiLink("2014 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}.

        Sainz and Kvyat remained with Toro Rosso for the {wikiLink("2017", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Formula_One_World_Championship")} season. Sainz scored points in the opening two races, but a collision with {wikiLink("Lance Stroll", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Stroll")} eliminated him from the {wikiLink("Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}.

Three points finishes followed including sixth place at the {wikiLink("Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}.

      <p>
        Prior to the {wikiLink("Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Austrian_Grand_Prix")}, Sainz commented that it was "unlikely" he would remain with Toro Rosso for a fourth year. Red Bull team principal {wikiLink("Christian Horner", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner")} rejected this, stating that Sainz would race for Toro Rosso in {wikiLink("2018", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. Sainz retired from the Austrian Grand Prix with an engine problem and was eliminated on the first lap of the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_British_Grand_Prix")} after a collision with Kvyat. Prior to the {wikiLink("Singapore Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Singapore_Grand_Prix")} it was announced that Sainz would join {wikiLink("Renault", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_F1")} for 2018, on loan from Red Bull. He finished the race in a career-best fourth place, in what he described as his "best day in Formula One".

Sainz retired from the race due to an engine problem. He crashed in practice for the {wikiLink("Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Japanese_Grand_Prix")} and again on the opening lap of the race. At this stage of the season, Sainz had scored 48 of Toro Rosso's 52 points.

These results included the {wikiLink("Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")} where he took advantage of a collision between Red Bull teammates {wikiLink("Max Verstappen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen")} and {wikiLink("Daniel Ricciardo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo")} to finish a season-high position of fifth. Sainz described his {wikiLink("Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Monaco_Grand_Prix")} as a "disaster" and criticised the team's tyre strategy having started eighth and finished tenth. He had run in sixth place for much of the {wikiLink("French Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_French_Grand_Prix")} but dropped to eighth place at the finish after his {wikiLink("MGU-K", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy_recovery_system")} failed.

He ended the season with a drive from eleventh on the grid to sixth place at the {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}. Sainz finished the season tenth in the Drivers' Championship, three places behind teammate Hülkenberg, scoring 53 points to Hülkenberg's 69. Sainz scored points in thirteen out of the nineteen races he finished. Sainz was replaced by Daniel Ricciardo at Renault for the following season, with the team opting to keep Hülkenberg on instead of Sainz.

        Sainz remained at McLaren alongside Norris for 2020, and began the season with a fifth-place finish at the {wikiLink("Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Austrian_Grand_Prix")}. He qualified third for the {wikiLink("Styrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Styrian_Grand_Prix")}, his best career qualifying result at that time. A slow pit stop contributed to him dropping to ninth place by the finish, however Sainz achieved his first {wikiLink("fastest lap in Formula One", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_F1_drivers_who_set_the_fastest_lap")} and in doing so set a new {wikiLink("Red Bull Ring", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Ring")} track record. Sainz was in fourth place with two laps of the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_British_Grand_Prix")} remaining but suffered a tyre puncture and was ultimately classified thirteenth. He started the {wikiLink("70th Anniversary Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/70th_Anniversary_Grand_Prix")} outside the top ten, but had progressed to fourth place when he entered the pits. A slow pit stop then dropped him back and he went on to finish thirteenth. He finished his home race, the {wikiLink("Spanish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Spanish_Grand_Prix")}, in sixth place, but then failed to start the {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Belgian_Grand_Prix")} due to a power unit issue on a reconnaissance lap.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the {wikiLink("Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Italian_Grand_Prix")}, Sainz qualified third behind the two {wikiLink("Mercedes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_in_F1")} drivers. He lost places during the pit stops and was in sixth place when the race was {wikiLink("red-flagged", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_flags#red_flag")} for {wikiLink("Charles Leclerc", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc")}'s accident. He passed three cars and benefited from Lewis Hamilton's penalty to move up to second place behind Pierre Gasly with twenty laps remaining. He ultimately finished 0.4 seconds behind Gasly to take his second podium and what was at the time his career best race finish. Sainz retired from the next two races; he was involved in a multi-car start-line accident at the {wikiLink("Tuscan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Tuscan_Grand_Prix")} and then crashed into a wall on the first lap of the {wikiLink("Russian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Russian_Grand_Prix")}. Seven consecutive points finishes then followed. He finished sixth at the {wikiLink("Portuguese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Portuguese_Grand_Prix")} having briefly led the race after gaining six positions in the first two laps. He started the {wikiLink("Turkish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Turkish_Grand_Prix")} in fifteenth place due to a penalty for impeding Sergio Pérez in qualifying, but gained six positions on the first lap and went on to finish fifth. A brake failure in qualifying at the {wikiLink("Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")} caused him to qualify fifteenth, but he progressed to fifth place by the end of the race.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sainz finished the 2020 season sixth in the Drivers' Championship for the second consecutive year. He accumulated 105 points to Norris's 97 and claimed six top-five finishes which, at the time, were both career highs.

        Sainz joined {wikiLink("Scuderia Ferrari", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari")} on a two-year contract from the {wikiLink("2021", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Formula_One_World_Championship")} season partnering {wikiLink("Charles Leclerc", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc")} and replacing {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")}. He qualified and finished in eighth place at the {wikiLink("Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, his first race for the team. He started eleventh at the {wikiLink("Emilia Romagna Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix")} but progressed to fifth place by the end of the race. He failed to score points at the {wikiLink("Portuguese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Portuguese_Grand_Prix")} despite starting fifth, stating "we got it wrong with strategy". He took his third career podium and first with Ferrari at the {wikiLink("Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}, where he benefited from Leclerc's failure to start and a pit stop issue for {wikiLink("Valtteri Bottas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas")} to finish second. Tyre wear issues meant neither Ferrari driver scored points at the {wikiLink("French Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_French_Grand_Prix")}. Sainz recovered from a twelfth-place start at the {wikiLink("Styrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Styrian_Grand_Prix")} to finish sixth. A collision with {wikiLink("George Russell", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)")} on the first lap of sprint qualifying at the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_British_Grand_Prix")} dropped Sainz to the back of the field, but he recovered places in sprint qualifying and in the race to finish sixth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sainz crashed in qualifying for the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")} and started fifteenth. He finished fourth on track, but claimed his fourth career podium finish after Sebastian Vettel's disqualification. He achieved his then-career-best qualifying position at the {wikiLink("Russian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Russian_Grand_Prix")}, starting second, and took the lead from former teammate Lando Norris on the first lap. Sainz went on to finish the race third. He recovered to eighth place at the {wikiLink("Turkish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Turkish_Grand_Prix")} having started from the back of the grid due to engine component penalties. Sainz achieved his fourth podium of the season at the {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}, but criticised the handling of the final-lap restart as being positioned behind lapped cars "nearly cost [him his] podium".
      </p>

      <p>
        Sainz ended the season fifth in the Drivers' Championship with 164.5 points, two positions and 5.5 points ahead of teammate Leclerc. His ability to adapt quickly to Ferrari and his performances relative to Leclerc were widely praised.

        Sainz continued at Ferrari alongside Leclerc for 2022. He qualified third for the season-opening {wikiLink("Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}. He ran in third place until Max Verstappen's retirement, allowing him into second place behind Leclerc to claim a Ferrari 1–2 finish and an early lead in the {wikiLink("Constructors' Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_World_Constructors%27_Champions")}. A mistake and then a {wikiLink("red flag", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_flags#Red_flag")} in qualifying at the {wikiLink("Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Australian_Grand_Prix")} meant he started in ninth place. He dropped places at the start and then spun into the gravel, ending his race on lap two. He crashed in qualifying for the {wikiLink("Emilia Romagna Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix")} and then a collision with Daniel Ricciardo ended his race at the first corner. He finished fourth at the {wikiLink("Spanish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Spanish_Grand_Prix")}, his best ever result at his home race, despite having earlier spun and dropped to eleventh. Sainz qualified and finished second at the {wikiLink("Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}, but a hydraulics issue caused his third retirement of the year at the {wikiLink("Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}. He was runner-up at the {wikiLink("Canadian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Canadian_Grand_Prix")}, less than a second behind Verstappen.
      </p>

      <p>
        For his 150th Formula One race start, the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_British_Grand_Prix")}, Sainz took his first Formula One {wikiLink("pole position", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_position")} in a wet qualifying session, beating Verstappen by 0.034 seconds. He was overtaken in the race by Verstappen, but regained the lead when Verstappen slowed with damage. He pitted for soft tyres in the closing laps and passed Leclerc to claim his maiden win in Formula One. Sainz was running third at the {wikiLink("Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Austrian_Grand_Prix")} when an engine failure ended his race. He started at the back of the grid at the {wikiLink("French Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_French_Grand_Prix")} after taking new engine components and finished fifth despite a time penalty for an unsafe pit release. He took his second pole position at the {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}, promoted to the front as Verstappen took an engine penalty, but dropped behind both Red Bulls to finish third.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sainz finished fifth at the {wikiLink("Dutch Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Dutch_Grand_Prix")} but was demoted to eighth by a penalty for an unsafe pit release. He started eighteenth at the {wikiLink("Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Italian_Grand_Prix")} with an engine component penalty but recovered to finish fourth. At the rain-affected {wikiLink("Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}, he crashed out from third place on the opening lap. He claimed his third pole position at the {wikiLink("United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_Grand_Prix")}, but retired with damage after being hit by George Russell at the first corner. After the final race, Sainz had matched his 2021 position with fifth in the Drivers' Championship and scored 246 points to Leclerc's 308.

He finished fourth at the {wikiLink("Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Australian_Grand_Prix")} but was penalised and demoted to twelfth place for making contact with Fernando Alonso at the second restart. Sainz criticised the penalty as being "unfair" and Alonso agreed that it was too harsh. Ferrari lodged a formal protest against the decision but were unsuccessful. Sainz qualified third at the {wikiLink("Miami Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Miami_Grand_Prix")} but finished fifth. He crashed in practice at the {wikiLink("Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Monaco_Grand_Prix")} and spun during the race, dropping him from fourth at the start to eighth at the finish.

        Sainz crashed in practice at the {wikiLink("Canadian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Canadian_Grand_Prix")} and was then penalised for impeding Pierre Gasly in qualifying, causing him to start the race eleventh. He recovered to finish fifth. He started the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_British_Grand_Prix")} fifth, however both Ferrari drivers made pit stops prior to a safety car period that other drivers took advantage of, dropping Sainz to tenth place at the finish line. At the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}, he crashed in practice and then qualified eleventh. He scored points by finishing the race eighth. He scored points again by finishing fourth in the {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Belgian_Grand_Prix")} sprint, but retired from the main race due to damage from a first-lap collision with {wikiLink("Oscar Piastri", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri")}. He achieved his first pole position of the year at the {wikiLink("Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Italian_Grand_Prix")}, 0.013 seconds ahead of Verstappen. He was passed by both Red Bulls during the race but defended from teammate Leclerc to finish third, his first podium of the season.
      </p>

      <p>
        He took pole position again at the next race, the {wikiLink("Singapore Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Singapore_Grand_Prix")}, and converted this into his second Formula One victory. This ended Red Bull's streak of fifteen consecutive wins and Max Verstappen's win streak of ten, and marked the only race of 2023 not won by Red Bull. Sainz led the entire race distance and he and former teammate Lando Norris held off Mercedes drivers George Russell and Lewis Hamilton in the closing laps.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sainz scored points in the {wikiLink("Qatar Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Qatar_Grand_Prix")} sprint, but qualified twelfth for the main race and then failed to start due to a fuel leak. He finished fourth at the {wikiLink("United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_United_States_Grand_Prix")} but was promoted to the podium after Hamilton's disqualification. He qualified second at the {wikiLink("Mexico City Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Mexico_City_Grand_Prix")} to make an all-Ferrari front row, but both cars were overtaken by Verstappen and Hamilton in the race. At the inaugural {wikiLink("Las Vegas Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Las_Vegas_Grand_Prix")}, Sainz hit a loose {wikiLink("manhole cover", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhole_cover")} in practice, causing the first practice session to be cancelled and the second to be delayed so that officials could inspect the rest of the track. He went on to qualify second behind Leclerc, but the damage to his car had required Ferrari to replace components and resulted in a ten-place grid penalty, which Ferrari team principal {wikiLink("Frédéric Vasseur", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frédéric_Vasseur")} described as "unacceptable". Sainz finished the race sixth. He crashed in practice at the season-ending {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")} and placed sixteenth in qualifying, after which he accused other drivers of deliberately impeding him. Ferrari left him out on track until the final lap in the hope of a safety car, but with no chance of scoring points, the team retired his car in the pits. Sainz described the result, which dropped him from fourth in the Drivers' Championship before the race to seventh, as "very disappointing". He ended his third season with Ferrari on 200 points to Leclerc's 206.

        At the {wikiLink("Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, Sainz began the 2024 season by qualifying fourth and finishing on the podium in third, ahead of teammate Charles Leclerc. During the {wikiLink("Saudi Arabian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")} weekend, Sainz fell ill with {wikiLink("appendicitis", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendicitis")} and was unable to participate. While he took part in FP1 and FP2, he missed the rest of the weekend to undergo surgery; he was replaced by reserve driver {wikiLink("Oliver Bearman", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Bearman")}. Having recovered from his surgery, Sainz returned at the {wikiLink("Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, qualifying second. He capitalised on Max Verstappen's retirement to win the race ahead of Leclerc, marking Sainz's third Formula One race victory and the first Ferrari one-two finish since the {wikiLink("2022 Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}. He took another podium finish at the {wikiLink("Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}, passing Leclerc to finish third.

      </p>

      <p>
        Sainz's next 3 races consisted of 5th place at the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_British_Grand_Prix")}, 6th place at the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")} and 6th at the {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Belgian_Grand_Prix")} meaning at the summer break Sainz sat 5th in the championship with 162 points.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sainz scored a second-place at the {wikiLink("United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_Grand_Prix")} and won the {wikiLink("Mexico City Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Mexico_City_Grand_Prix")} from pole position, before crashing out of the rain-affected {wikiLink("São Paulo Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_São_Paulo_Grand_Prix")}. He recorded a third-place at the {wikiLink("Las Vegas Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Las_Vegas_Grand_Prix")} and sixth in {wikiLink("Qatar", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Qatar_Grand_Prix")}. At the season-ending {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}, he finished on the podium to clinch fifth-place in the championship on a career-best 290 points.
