        In 2013, Sainz signed with{" "}
        {wikiLink("Arden", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arden_International")} to compete in the GP3 series. During the first qualifying session of the year, he qualified in 5th place, 5 tenths off of pole sitter{" "}
        {wikiLink("Kevin Korjus", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Korjus")}. However, he, as well as{" "}

        {wikiLink("Patrick Kujala", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Kujala")}, were penalised 10 places for ignoring{" "}
        {wikiLink("yellow flags", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_flag_(motorsport)")} during free practice. During the beginning of race one, Sainz got up to 13th place by passing Alex Fontana and{" "}
        {wikiLink("Jimmy Eriksson", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Eriksson")} off the start. By the start of lap 3, he was 13 seconds behind the leader. Sainz made it up to 8th place with his teammate{" "}
        {wikiLink("Daniil Kvyat", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Kvyat")} until both cars lacked grip. Because they were both pushing to get into the top ten for points, neither driver decided to manage their Pirelli tyres and so by the end of the race, Kvyat was 20th and Sainz was 15th. He finished 51 seconds off first placed man{" "}
        {wikiLink("Tio Ellinas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tio_Ellinas")}.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sainz started in 15th place for race 2 on Sunday morning. At the end of lap 1, he was in 9th place. As they approached lap 2, the safety car was deployed due to an accident behind, giving Sainz time to save his tyres. With 5 laps remaining, Sainz was up to 8th place. During the next lap, he put a move on{" "}
        {wikiLink("Jack Harvey", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Harvey")} 's ART car to move up into 7th place. Sainz eventually would finish in 7th place. However, post-race investigating revealed that Sainz's car was underweight, so he was disqualified from the final results from race 2, thus scoring no points. His teammate,{" "}
        {wikiLink("Daniil Kvyat", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Kvyat")}, retired during the race due to contact with another driver.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Valencia, Sainz began, and finished, the race in 8th place. In race 2, he started in 4th place and got up to 3rd place by the end of lap 1. He remained in that position, scoring a podium for the first time in GP3. Sainz obtained 24 world championship points, 4 for fastest laps in both races. He was now in 6th place in the championship overall.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the first race in Silverstone, Sainz was squeezed off track, falling to 9th place. By mid-distance, Sainz overtook{" "}
        {wikiLink("Lewis Williamson", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Williamson")} to get into 8th place. Williamson then moved alongside Sainz to try and overtake, but Sainz kept moving over towards him until there was contact. Williamson was sent into a spin whilst Sainz continued to circulate around the track. Due to the damage to his car, Sainz fell down the order until he crossed the finish line in 13th place. In race 2, he finished where he started, in 13th place.
