        Leclerc signed for {wikiLink("Sauber", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauber")} in {wikiLink("2018", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Formula_One_World_Championship")} as a full-time driver, replacing {wikiLink("Pascal Wehrlein", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Wehrlein")} to partner {wikiLink("Marcus Ericsson", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Ericsson")}. With his debut at the {wikiLink("2018 Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, Leclerc became the {wikiLink("first Monégasque driver", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_drivers_from_Monaco")} to compete in Formula One since {wikiLink("Olivier Beretta", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Beretta")} in {wikiLink("1994", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. He qualified eighteenth and finished thirteenth on debut. After non-scoring finishes in {wikiLink("Bahrain", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("China", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Chinese_Grand_Prix")}, a sixth-placed finish at the {wikiLink("Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")} saw him become the first Monégasque driver to score points in Formula One since {wikiLink("Louis Chiron", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Chiron")} in {wikiLink("1950", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}. He scored another point by finishing tenth at the {wikiLink("Spanish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Spanish_Grand_Prix")}.
      
        At his first {wikiLink("home Grand Prix in Monaco", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}, Leclerc suffered a brake failure in the closing laps, colliding with the {wikiLink("diffuser", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuser_(automotive)")} of {wikiLink("Brendon Hartley", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendon_Hartley")} into the {wikiLink("Nouvelle Chicane", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_Monaco")} and forcing his first career retirement.

        This run included three retirements: a loose wheel in {wikiLink("Britain", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_British_Grand_Prix")}, suspension damage after colliding with {wikiLink("Sergio Pérez", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Pérez")} in {wikiLink("Hungary", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}, and a multi-car collision in {wikiLink("Belgium", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}. Leclerc credited the {wikiLink("halo device", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_device")} with saving him from severe injury during the latter, stating that he "was very happy to have it over [his] head".
        
        Further points finishes came with ninth- and seventh-place at the {wikiLink("Singapore", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Singapore_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Russian", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Russian_Grand_Prix")} Grands Prix, respectively, before retirements from a mechanical failure in {wikiLink("Japan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Japanese_Grand_Prix")} and damage from a collision with {wikiLink("Romain Grosjean", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romain_Grosjean")} in the {wikiLink("United States", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_United_States_Grand_Prix")}.

        He took pole again in {wikiLink("2019 Singapore Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Singapore_Grand_Prix")} and finished second after being undercut by teammate Vettel, promoting him to third in the championship.

        In {wikiLink("2019 Russian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Russian_Grand_Prix")}, he took his fourth consecutive pole and finished third, after a {wikiLink("virtual safety car", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_safety_car")} allowed both Mercedes drivers to gain positions with shortened {wikiLink("pit stops", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop")}.
        He qualified second at the {wikiLink("2019 Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}, but took damage in a first-lap collision with Verstappen after understeering into his sidepod, and finished sixth.

He retired from the {wikiLink("Sakhir Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Sakhir_Grand_Prix")} after a first-lap collision with Pérez—for which he was given a three-place {wikiLink("grid penalty", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_motorsport_terms#G")}—having qualified fourth. Ferrari struggled for pace at the season-ending {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}, with Leclerc finishing thirteenth. He ended the season eighth in the standings with two podiums and 98 points, 65 ahead of teammate Vettel in thirteenth, as Ferrari finished sixth in the {wikiLink("World Constructors' Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Constructors%27_Championship")}—their lowest since {wikiLink("1980", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Formula_One_season")}.

          Leclerc was partnered by {wikiLink("Carlos Sainz Jr.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr.")} at Ferrari for his {wikiLink("2021", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Formula_One_World_Championship")} campaign. He started the {wikiLink("2021 Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")} in fourth and finished sixth. He then finished fourth at the {wikiLink("2021 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix")} amidst a radio issue. His sixth-placed finish in {wikiLink("2021 Portuguese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Portuguese_Grand_Prix")} dropped him to fifth in the standings, before he finished fourth again in {wikiLink("2021 Spanish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Spanish_Grand_Prix")}. Leclerc secured a surprise pole position at {wikiLink("his home Grand Prix in Monaco", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}—his first since the {wikiLink("2019 Mexican Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Mexican_Grand_Prix")}—after colliding with the barrier at {wikiLink("La Piscine", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_Monaco")} in the final part of qualifying, but was unable to start the race due to a related {wikiLink("drive shaft", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_shaft")} issue. He qualified on pole again at the next round in {wikiLink("2021 Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}, before finishing fourth. Tyre wear struggles at the {wikiLink("2021 French Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_French_Grand_Prix")} saw him finish sixteenth after taking an additional {wikiLink("pit stop", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop")}.

At the {wikiLink("2021 British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_British_Grand_Prix")}, Leclerc qualified fourth before inheriting the lead on the first lap: he overtook Bottas off-the-line before passing both {wikiLink("Max Verstappen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen")} and Hamilton after their collision. He held the lead until the antepenultimate lap—when Hamilton passed him—finishing in second-place to claim his sole podium of the season. Leclerc retired from the rain-affected {wikiLink("2021 Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")} after a first-lap collision with {wikiLink("Lance Stroll", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Stroll")}, demoting him to seventh in the championship, below teammate Sainz. He finished eighth at the curtailed {wikiLink("2021 Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}, and fifth in the {wikiLink("2021 Dutch Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Dutch_Grand_Prix")}. In {wikiLink("2021 Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Italian_Grand_Prix")}, Leclerc finished fourth after a penalty for Pérez. He took grid penalties for the {wikiLink("2021 Russian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Russian_Grand_Prix")}, forcing him to start nineteenth; after climbing to third, he was the last to pit for {wikiLink("intermediate tyres", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_tyres")} in changing conditions, demoting him to fifteenth. Leclerc finished fourth at both the {wikiLink("2021 Turkish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Turkish_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("2021 United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Grand_Prix")}, leading several laps at the former, before finishing fifth in {wikiLink("2021 Mexico City Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Mexico_City_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("2021 São Paulo Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix")}.

At the {wikiLink("2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}, a pit stop gamble under the {wikiLink("virtual safety car", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_safety_car")} saw Leclerc lose track position, ultimately finishing in tenth; this result saw both Sainz and Norris surpass his points tally, with Leclerc finishing seventh in the World Drivers' Championship on 159 points. This marked the first time Leclerc had been outscored by a teammate in his {wikiLink("formula racing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_racing")} career.

          After finishing second to Verstappen in another close-fought battle in {wikiLink("Saudi Arabia", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")}, Leclerc took a dominant victory from pole at the {wikiLink("Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, achieving his maiden {wikiLink("grand slam", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(Formula_One)")} in Formula One and extending his championship lead to 34 points over {wikiLink("George Russell", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)")} and 46 ahead of Verstappen in sixth.
