        Early Mercedes Association and F1 Tests
      </h3>

      <p>In October 2015, Russell drove a Formula One car for the first time, when he tested the {wikiLink("McLaren MP4-26", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MP4-26")} at {wikiLink("Silverstone", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit")} as a prize for winning the 2014 {wikiLink("Autosport BRDC Award", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosport_BRDC_Award")}.</p>

      <p>Russell signed with the {wikiLink("Mercedes Junior Team", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Junior_Team")} in early 2017, due to the high cost of racing in the junior categories. He had previously spent 2016 as a Mercedes simulator driver. In addition, he impressed Mercedes team principal {wikiLink("Toto Wolff", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toto_Wolff")} with a {wikiLink("Microsoft PowerPoint", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint")} presentation explaining why Wolff should sign him. Wolff "set hard targets" for Russell, asking him to win the GP3 and Formula 2 titles before progressing to Formula One.</p>

      <p>During Russell's junior career, Mercedes gave him several opportunities to drive a Formula One car. He drove a Mercedes for the first time in April 2017, testing the 2015 {wikiLink("Mercedes F1 W06 Hybrid", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_F1_W06_Hybrid")} at {wikiLink("Portimão", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portimão_Circuit")}. He then conducted formal test drives for {wikiLink("Mercedes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One")} (2017 and 2018) and {wikiLink("Force India", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_India")} (2018). Russell made his Grand Prix weekend debut at the end of the 2017 season, driving for Force India during free practice at the {wikiLink("2017 Brazilian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Brazilian_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("2017 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}. Mercedes promoted him to first-team reserve driver in 2018.</p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-red-600 mb-2">Williams (2019–2021)</h3>

    <p>
      In October 2018, Mercedes arranged for Russell to make his Formula One debut with engine customer {wikiLink("Williams", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Racing")}-Mercedes. Russell had previously applied for a Williams drive after winning the 2017 GP3 title, but Williams' {wikiLink("Paddy Lowe", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddy_Lowe")} was unmoved by his new PowerPoint presentation and Russell went to Formula Two. Russell signed a three-year contract with Williams but remained a Mercedes test driver. He was partnered by {wikiLink("Robert Kubica", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kubica")} for the {wikiLink("2019 season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Formula_One_World_Championship")} and {wikiLink("Nicholas Latifi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Latifi")} in {wikiLink("2020", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Formula_One_World_Championship")} and {wikiLink("2021", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. His first appearance for Williams was at the 2018 post-season test at {wikiLink("Yas Marina Circuit", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yas_Marina_Circuit")}, driving the {wikiLink("FW41", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_FW41")}.
    </p>

    <p>
      Russell's years at Williams were difficult. Mercedes had hoped that Williams would field a competitive car; as Russell later noted, Williams had finished no worse than fifth in the constructors' standings from {wikiLink("2015", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Formula_One_World_Championship")} to {wikiLink("2017", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. However, when Russell joined Williams, the team was well behind the rest of the field and did not produce a car that could reliably compete for points until 2021, Russell's final year with the team. The team was so strapped for cash that it considered replacing Russell with {wikiLink("Kevin Magnussen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen")} after the 2020 season if Magnussen could find enough sponsor money to keep the team afloat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Due to Russell's extended run at Williams, he is third on the list of {wikiLink("most race starts in a career before scoring points", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_driver_records#Most_races_before_scoring_points")}, with 37. However, the Formula One team principals viewed his performances more favorably. In 2020, a year where Russell scored only three points and finished 18th in the standings, the team principals ranked him that year's sixth-best driver. In addition, Russell led Williams back to respectability in 2021, scoring 16 points and recording a rare podium for Williams.

    <p>In 2019, Williams struggled for form. At Russell's Formula One race debut, the {wikiLink("2019 Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, Russell qualified 19th and finished 16th.<sup>[86]</sup> He acknowledged that his experience was difficult, remarking that the car was "four seconds off the pace" and that he was lapped multiple times.<sup>[87]</sup> Williams' slow pace continued into the season, and in most races {wikiLink("Robert Kubica", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kubica")} was Russell's only on-track competition: Russell did not finish ahead of a car from another team until round six, the {wikiLink("2019 Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}. He also outqualified Kubica at all twenty-one races.<sup>[88]</sup></p>

    <p>Russell's best placement was 11th at the rain-affected {wikiLink("2019 German Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_German_Grand_Prix")}, where Williams rolled out an upgrade.<sup>[89]</sup> Six cars retired without classifying,<sup>[90]</sup> and another two cars received time penalties after the race.<sup>[91]</sup> He came close to finishing 10th, but unsuccessfully asked to pit for slick tyres during a safety car and ran wide on turn two several laps later,<sup>[92]</sup> allowing {wikiLink("Robert Kubica", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kubica")} to overtake him and score the team's only point that year.<sup>[91]</sup> In 2023, Russell remarked that it was the most disappointing moment of his career.<sup>[93]</sup></p>

    <p>Russell also finished 12th at the {wikiLink("2019 Brazilian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Brazilian_Grand_Prix")} after a late safety car allowed him to unlap himself, missing out on points by 1.668 seconds.<sup>[94]</sup> He finished 20th in the Drivers' Championship, scoring no points to Kubica's one.<sup>[95]</sup> Russell later remarked that as a competitor, it was hard for him to watch fellow rookies {wikiLink("Alex Albon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Albon")} and {wikiLink("Lando Norris", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris")} competing for points and podiums after beating them the year before in F2.<sup>[87]</sup></p>

    <p>Williams was more competitive on track in 2020, but it did not show up in the standings, as Williams did not score any points all year.<sup>[96]</sup> However, Russell came close to scoring on several occasions, such as the {wikiLink("2020 Styrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Styrian_Grand_Prix")} (starting 11th but falling to 16th after running into the gravel during a re-start lap),<sup>[97][98]</sup> the {wikiLink("2020 British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_British_Grand_Prix")} (finishing 12th), the {wikiLink("2020 Tuscan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Tuscan_Grand_Prix")} (reaching 9th at one point before dropping back to 11th),<sup>[99]</sup> and the {wikiLink("2020 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix")} (crashing out from 10th place under safety car conditions).<sup>[100]</sup></p>

    <p>Russell scored his first points at the {wikiLink("2020 Sakhir Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Sakhir_Grand_Prix")}, following a surprise promotion to the Mercedes senior team when {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")} tested positive for COVID-19.<sup>[101]</sup> His performance at Sakhir was widely acclaimed by both Mercedes and the media.<sup>[102][103]</sup> He narrowly missed out on pole position,<sup>[104]</sup> overtook teammate {wikiLink("Valtteri Bottas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas")} at the first corner, and led the majority of the race. However, he was forced to pit twice in-a-row when the Mercedes pit crew accidentally fitted Bottas' front tyres on his car, following a radio failure.<sup>[105][106]</sup> He overtook Bottas a second time, recovered to second place, and was closing in on race leader {wikiLink("Sergio Pérez", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Pérez")} when a puncture forced him to pit again with ten laps to go.<sup>[107]</sup> He finished ninth, picking up two points for the finish and one point for the fastest lap.<sup>[108][109]</sup></p>

    <p>He later remarked that while "I was the same driver [in Sakhir] as I had been before ... I was exactly the same driver a week later [driving for Williams at the season-ending {wikiLink("2020 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}] when I was out in Q1."<sup>[110][111]</sup> In Abu Dhabi, he donned a special helmet to honor the Williams family, who had sold the team in October.<sup>[112][113]</sup> He finished 18th in the Drivers' Championship, scoring 3 points, all for Mercedes.<sup>[83]</sup></p>

    <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-red-400 mb-1">2021: Maiden podium</h4>

    <p>Following Russell's strong performances in 2020, Mercedes looked into finding him a new team for the {wikiLink("2021 season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, but {wikiLink("Williams", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Racing")} declined to release him from his contract.</p>

    <p>In addition, the media speculated that he would replace {wikiLink("Valtteri Bottas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas")} at {wikiLink("Mercedes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One")} in 2022 once their respective contracts expired.</p>

    <p>The two aspirants clashed at the {wikiLink("2021 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix")}, when Russell found himself alongside Bottas on lap 30. He attempted to overtake Bottas, but drove onto a wet patch and lost control of his car, crashing into Bottas and causing a double retirement.</p>

    <p>Russell initially blamed the incident on Bottas, walking over to Bottas after the crash and slapping his helmet (Bottas responded with a middle finger), and accusing him of "trying to kill [them] both".</p>

    <p>However, Russell later retracted his claims and apologised to Bottas and Williams. {wikiLink("Toto Wolff", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toto_Wolff")} acknowledged that Bottas should not have been side by side with a Williams in the first place, but reserved the bulk of his criticism for Russell, a Mercedes junior who had just taken out a Mercedes.</p>

    <p>Both drivers sought to downplay the dispute, at least publicly, after Bottas rejoined Mercedes in {wikiLink("2025", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Formula_One_World_Championship")}.</p>

    <p>
      Despite his DNF at Imola, Russell helped Williams to its best season in several years. He came close to scoring points at a number of races, including the{" "}
      {wikiLink("Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")} (gearbox failure following a restart in 15th place), the{" "}

    </p>

    <p>
      At the {wikiLink("Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Austrian_Grand_Prix")}, Russell qualified in 8th place, Williams' highest grid position since 2017.
      He was still in 10th near the end of the race, but after a fourteen-lap defensive battle,{" "}
      {wikiLink("Fernando Alonso", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso")} passed him with three laps to go. After the race, Alonso consoled Russell with a hug. 
      The Spaniard ruefully explained that “I was hoping it was anyone but him. ... He will have more opportunities hopefully for podiums or wins in the future.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Russell scored his first points for Williams two races later at the{" "}
      {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}, moving from 17th on the grid to 8th.
      Following the race, Mercedes agreed to promote Russell to the senior team for the 2022 season.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the very next race, Russell collected his maiden podium at the{" "}
      {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Belgian_Grand_Prix")} under unusual circumstances. He qualified in second after a rain-affected Saturday,
      the first front-row start for Williams since the{" "}
      {wikiLink("2017 Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Italian_Grand_Prix")}.
      The downpour continued into race day, so the race director ran the race for two laps under safety car conditions before calling it off, handing Russell his first Formula One podium finish.

    <p>
      Russell also scored points at the{" "}

    <p>
      2022 and 2023 were difficult years for Mercedes, whose new aerodynamics concept performed very well in simulations but was difficult to drive in real life. The team scored one victory in two years.
    </p>

    <p>
      Russell and Hamilton spent the first nine races of the 2022 season testing experimental parts for the Mercedes car. Although the drivers swapped testing duties every race, Russell accumulated a 34-point lead over Hamilton after round nine, which team boss Toto Wolff attributed to Hamilton's experiments backfiring.
    </p>

    <p>
      After round nine, Russell and Hamilton finished out the season essentially level on points, with Russell scoring one more point than his teammate. Despite the unfortunate season, Russell checked off several career firsts in 2022, including his first podium in a full-length race at Melbourne; his first pole position at Hungary; and his first Grand Prix and sprint race victories at Interlagos.
    </p>

    <p>
      He finished fourth in the Drivers' Championship, outscoring teammate Hamilton by 35 points.

      2023 was another difficult year for Mercedes and for Russell in particular. After some promising performances at the start of the season — leading the {wikiLink("Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Australian_Grand_Prix")} until an untimely red flag and scoring a podium at {wikiLink("Barcelona", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Spanish_Grand_Prix")} — Russell's results declined in the second half of the season for a variety of reasons.
    </p>

    <p>
      These included a record seven pit stops in one race at {wikiLink("Zandvoort", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Dutch_Grand_Prix")}, an accidental last-lap crash at {wikiLink("Singapore", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Singapore_Grand_Prix")}, an over-aggressive strategy call at {wikiLink("Suzuka", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}, and {wikiLink("Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")} colliding into him after a front-row start at {wikiLink("Lusail", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Qatar_Grand_Prix")}.
    </p>

    <p>
      Russell salvaged a measure of pride with a third-place finish at the {wikiLink("2023 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}, which clinched second place in the Constructors' Championship for Mercedes.
    </p>

    <p>
      He finished eighth in the Drivers' Championship, the lowest for a Mercedes driver since {wikiLink("2012", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, and 59 points behind {wikiLink("Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")}. After the Abu Dhabi race, Russell commented that he had "let the side down a couple of times this year", but that it meant "a huge amount" to help the team finish second.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although he called his own season "a complete disaster", Mercedes extended his contract until the end of {wikiLink("2025", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Formula_One_World_Championship")}.

    <p>For the {wikiLink("2024 season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, Mercedes fundamentally changed its design concept. The new {wikiLink("Mercedes W15", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_W15")} was fast but inconsistent, hard on tyres, and difficult to set up properly. Although the team was not competitive until midseason, Russell commented that the staff was "making progress" behind the scenes. At round three, the {wikiLink("Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, Russell crashed heavily while trying to overtake {wikiLink("Fernando Alonso", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso")} for sixth place on the penultimate lap. The accident left him immobile and defenceless behind a 250 km/h blind turn for ten seconds before the race director deployed the virtual safety car. However, he emerged unscathed and met with Alonso to smooth things over. Following the race, he called for automated safety cars to prevent similar incidents.</p>

    <p>
    At midseason, Mercedes scored podium finishes in six consecutive races. Russell reeled off some of his best results in years, including a pole and podium in {wikiLink("Montreal", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Canadian_Grand_Prix")}, his second career race victory at {wikiLink("Spielberg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Austrian_Grand_Prix")} (albeit after the first two drivers collided in front of him), a pole at {wikiLink("Silverstone", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_British_Grand_Prix")} followed by a mechanical retirement, and the first Formula One race win lost to a post-race disqualification since 1994 at {wikiLink("Spa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}, for which the team took responsibility. However, the media opined that he could have won the Canadian Grand Prix.
    </p>

    The team's form became more inconsistent as the year went on, but Russell challenged for wins at several races. At the {wikiLink("São Paulo Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_São_Paulo_Grand_Prix")}, Russell was leading the race until Mercedes ordered him to pit for new tyres right before a red flag gave his competitors a free tyre change. Russell dominated the {wikiLink("Las Vegas Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Las_Vegas_Grand_Prix")}, qualifying on pole and leading 49 of 50 laps to take his third career victory. Russell again qualified on pole in {wikiLink("Qatar", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Qatar_Grand_Prix")} after {wikiLink("Max Verstappen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen")} was handed a grid penalty for driving unnecessarily slowly ahead of Russell, who was on an out-lap. Verstappen condemned Russell's appeals to the stewards for his penalty, stating he "lost all respect" for him and warned Russell that he would overtake him at any cost. Verstappen overtook him into turn one, with Russell finishing fourth after two safety car periods.

    Russell finished sixth in the Drivers' Championship, 22 points ahead of Hamilton.

    <p>
      In {wikiLink("2025", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, following Hamilton's departure for Ferrari, Mercedes partnered Russell with {wikiLink("Junior Team", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Junior_Team")} member {wikiLink("Andrea Kimi Antonelli", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Kimi_Antonelli")}. Russell's contract expires at the end of the season, although team principal Toto Wolff suggested that there are “options” to extend the contract to an unspecified date.

      Going into 2025, defending constructors' champion {wikiLink("McLaren", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren")} were heavily favoured to defend their title, and McLaren's {wikiLink("Lando Norris", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris")} and {wikiLink("Oscar Piastri", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri")} were also favoured to win the drivers' title. Russell opined that the {wikiLink("McLaren MCL39", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MCL39")} was fast enough to win every race in 2025, although McLaren dismissed his claim as hyperbolic.
    </p>

    <p>
      Russell started 2025 with three podiums in four races at {wikiLink("Albert Park", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("Shanghai", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Chinese_Grand_Prix")}, and {wikiLink("Sakhir", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, although in each case, he spent most of the race trailing one or both of the dominant McLarens. In Australia, he raced conservatively in intermittently rainy conditions and inherited third place when Piastri went off track. At Shanghai, Russell qualified second for the feature race, splitting the two McLarens; however, good teamwork from the McLarens allowed Norris to pass him at turn one, and Russell finished third despite a late charge when Norris' brakes failed. Russell also finished fourth in the Chinese sprint race after multiple battles with {wikiLink("Charles Leclerc", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc")}, who finished fifth.
    </p>

    <p>
      After an uneventful fifth-place finish at {wikiLink("Suzuka", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Japanese_Grand_Prix")} with almost no overtaking within the top ten, Russell bounced back in Bahrain. He fended off Norris in the closing laps to finish second, overcoming a one-place grid penalty and faulty brakes and electronics, and received widespread praise from the racing press for his adaptive performance. Even so, race winner Piastri beat him by fifteen seconds.
