        Norris remained with McLaren for 2023, partnered by rookie {wikiLink("Oscar Piastri", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri")} who replaced Ricciardo. At the first race at Bahrain, both McLaren cars experienced reliability issues. 
        Norris made six pit stops to manage the problem and finished seventeenth and last of the finishing drivers. He was eliminated in the first qualifying session (Q1) for the first time since 2019 at the {wikiLink("Saudi Arabian Grand Prix",
