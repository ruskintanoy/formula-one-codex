        Haas was the first American constructor to submit an F1 entry after the failed {wikiLink("US F1", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_F1_Team")} project in {wikiLink("2010", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, and it is the first American constructor to compete since the unrelated {wikiLink("Haas Lola", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haas_Lola")} outfit raced in the {wikiLink("1985", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_Formula_One_World_Championship")} and {wikiLink("1986", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_Formula_One_World_Championship")} seasons. The Haas Lola team was owned by former {wikiLink("McLaren", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren")} boss {wikiLink("Teddy Mayer", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Mayer")} and {wikiLink("Carl Haas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Haas")}, who was not related to {wikiLink("Gene Haas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Haas")}.

        <p>
        Unrestricted by testing regulations until the time the team actually entered Formula One, Haas shook its new car down in December 2015 ahead of official pre-season testing at Barcelona in early 2016. Haas approached Italian manufacturer {wikiLink("Dallara", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallara")} to build their chassis, with a power unit supplied by {wikiLink("Ferrari", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari")}.

        <p>
        Haas's approach of establishing a far-reaching partnership with {wikiLink("Ferrari", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari")} was met with a mixed response from the paddock. The constructor was applauded for pioneering a low-cost model that would allow new teams to enter the sport and be competitive, which had been of concern to the sport for some years. Conversely, Haas's approach was criticized by smaller, privateer teams who had invested in their own infrastructure and expressed concerns about the close relationship between manufacturers and satellite constructors handing more political power to the sport's larger constructors.
        </p>

        <p>
        In 2018 Haas again came under fire from competitors after arriving at winter testing with a car that strongly resembled the {wikiLink("Ferrari SF70H", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_SF70H")}, Ferrari's 2017 car. Competitors {wikiLink("McLaren", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren")} and {wikiLink("Force India", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_India")} both criticized the partnership between Ferrari and Haas. While no official grievance was filled with the {wikiLink("FIA", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_Internationale_de_l%27Automobile")}, McLaren boss {wikiLink("Zak Brown", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Brown")} questioned the relationship.
        </p>

        <p>
        During {wikiLink("2021", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Formula_One_World_Championship")} rule discussions in April 2019, concerns over Haas F1's B-team approach were presented by Renault and McLaren. F1 Director of Motorsports {wikiLink("Ross Brawn", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Brawn")} said that he wants to protect and enhance the model for the foreseeable future as it allows teams with smaller budgets to enter the sport.
        </p>

        <p>
        Haas have depended upon Ferrari for their reserve drivers in the past. In particular they did two FP1 sessions for Ferrari reserve {wikiLink("Antonio Giovinazzi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Giovinazzi")}. Additionally during his tenure at the team, {wikiLink("Mick Schumacher", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Schumacher")} was still a Ferrari Academy Driver and Ferrari Reserve driver. Ferrari junior {wikiLink("Oliver Bearman", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Bearman")}, who will join the team from 2025 onward, has completed an FP1 session for Haas and has also substituted for Kevin Magnussen due to him receiving a ban at the {wikiLink("2024 Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}, and again due to his illness at the {wikiLink("2024 São Paulo Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix")}.

        <p>
        In October 2024, Haas announced a technical partnership with {wikiLink("Toyota", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_in_Formula_One")}, although engines would continue to be provided by Ferrari. This would see the team integrate the services of {wikiLink("Toyota Gazoo Racing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Gazoo_Racing")}, and the {wikiLink("Toyota", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota")} name again to be associated with the sport after 15 years ever since they completely withdrew at the end of 2009 season. The Japanese automaker in the past was involved in Formula One from 2002–2009 as a factory works team and also as an engine supplier to few other teams including {wikiLink("Williams F1 Team", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Racing")} and {wikiLink("Jordan F1 Team", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Grand_Prix")}. In April 2025, as part of their technical partnership, Haas signed Toyota driver Ryō Hirakawa as their test driver for the 2025 season.

Following a strong showing during winter testing, Haas again had a competitive weekend in {wikiLink("Australia", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, scoring the team's best-ever starting grid positions with Magnussen starting 5th and Grosjean 6th, respectively. During the race, they were running in 4th, and 5th positions which would have given them their best result and half of their 2017 points tally, but both cars retired one lap after their respective pit stops. They would eventually match this 4th and 5th-place result in {wikiLink("Austria", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Austrian_Grand_Prix")}, surpassing their 2017 points total after only nine races.

This was part of the activation of a multi-year title sponsorship deal with Rich Energy, a British energy drink company that was previously linked to purchasing {wikiLink("Force India", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_India")}. The team also retained their 2018 driver line up for 2019 consisting of Grosjean and Magnussen for the third consecutive year.

        The {wikiLink("VF-19", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haas_VF-19")} often showed impressive pace during qualifying but struggled during the race. At the opening race in {wikiLink("Australia", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, Magnussen finished 6th in what would eventually be the team's best season result. The team's qualifying pace was evident in {wikiLink("Austria", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Austrian_Grand_Prix")}, where Magnussen recorded the 5th-fastest time but finished the race in 19th with Grosjean 16th. Four days before the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_British_Grand_Prix")}, in July, the Rich Energy Twitter account announced that the sponsorship deal had been terminated, citing poor performance. This was later denied by both the team and Rich Energy's shareholders, and it was asserted that the tweet was the result of a "rogue" individual. For the British Grand Prix the team elected to reverse the upgrades placed on Grosjean's car, using the same specification run in Australia, to determine the causes of the car's poor race pace. However, both drivers collided with each other on the first lap, causing a double retirement for the team. The {wikiLink("German Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_German_Grand_Prix")} provided the team's best-combined result of the season, being classified 7th and 8th after post-race penalties for other drivers.

        Title sponsor {wikiLink("Rich Energy", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Energy")} faced numerous legal issues during the year, including being found to have plagiarized the logo of bicycle manufacturer {wikiLink("Whyte Bikes", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whyte_Bikes")}. In September, a day after the {wikiLink("Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Italian_Grand_Prix")}, Rich Energy announced the termination of the deal with Haas with immediate effect.

        Grosjean and Magnussen left Haas at the end of the 2020 Championship. They were replaced by Russian {wikiLink("Nikita Mazepin", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Mazepin")}, and {wikiLink("2020 Formula 2 Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Formula_2_Championship")} winner {wikiLink("Mick Schumacher", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Schumacher")}, son of seven-time Formula One world champion {wikiLink("Michael Schumacher", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schumacher")}. To survive financially, the team opted to halt the development of the 2021 car, instead focusing resources on the 2022 car. They also secured {wikiLink("Uralkali", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uralkali")}, a Russian {wikiLink("potash", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potash")} fertilizer producer, of which Mazepin's father {wikiLink("Dmitry Mazepin", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Mazepin")} is a key shareholder, as the title sponsor for the team. Uralkali's sponsorship resulted in a livery containing the colors of the {wikiLink("Russian flag", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Russia")}. Steiner denied this was to circumvent a {wikiLink("World Anti-Doping Agency", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency")} ban on the use of the Russian flag and anthem following a {wikiLink("state-sponsored doping scandal", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_Russia")} in the country.

        <p>
        During the {wikiLink("first race", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, Mazepin spun out on the first lap, while Schumacher finished 16th in his debut, the last of all running cars. In the season's final race, Mazepin tested positive for {wikiLink("coronavirus", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2")} and was ruled out of the race. Haas would only field one driver, rather than replace Mazepin with reserve driver {wikiLink("Pietro Fittipaldi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Fittipaldi")}, as he had not fulfilled the requirement of having competed in a practice session for the team.

        Following the {wikiLink("Russian invasion of Ukraine", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine")}, Haas removed the branding of Russian sponsor Uralkali from its cars and the colors of the Russian flag. On March 5, the team announced it had terminated its title sponsorship deal with Uralkali and its driver contract with Mazepin. {wikiLink("Kevin Magnussen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen")}, who previously drove for the team from 2017 to 2020, was announced as his replacement.
        </p>

        <p>
        Haas's decision to focus on building the VF-22 throughout the 2021 season resulted in the car proving to be competitive among the mid-field teams. With Magnussen returning, Haas scored in the two opening races of the season in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia with Magnussen; Schumacher failed to score points in Bahrain and did not start in Saudi Arabia due to a crash in qualifying. In the following races, Magnussen and Schumacher struggled to score points or finish the race as both drivers were sometimes in contact with other drivers despite their high starting position after qualifying.

        After a points drought, Haas took a double points finish at the {wikiLink("2022 British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_British_Grand_Prix")} with Magnussen finishing 10th and Schumacher 8th; his first-ever point finish as a Formula One driver and the first double-point finish for Haas after three years. The momentum was maintained by Magnussen finishing 8th and Schumacher finishing 6th in the following race in {wikiLink("2022 Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Austrian_Grand_Prix")}. These back-to-back double points finishes placed Haas seventh in the Constructors' Championship, after the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}.

        At the {wikiLink("Canadian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Canadian_Grand_Prix")}, Hülkenberg achieved the team's best qualifying position of the season to date when he qualified in second in a wet qualifying session in which he benefitted from {wikiLink("McLaren", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren")}'s {wikiLink("Oscar Piastri", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri")} crash in the early part of the qualifying session, which brought out the red flag. The rest of the grid were not able to improve on their qualifying as the rain got heavier when the session restarted. However, Hülkenberg was handed a three-place grid penalty for a red flag infraction and would start the race in fifth position. Magnussen would start the race in 14th position.
        </p>

        <p>
        Haas finished the season 10th in the constructors championship with 12 points. This was due to a season of good qualifying sessions but due to the {wikiLink("VF-23", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haas_VF-23")}'s high tyre wear it meant the drivers would struggle and slip down the order during races. The most notable example of this, was {wikiLink("Nico Hülkenberg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_H%C3%BClkenberg")} qualifying 5th at the Canadian Grand Prix but due to the VF-23's aggressive tyre wear, by the chequered flag Hülkenberg had slipped down to 15th place. Haas scored points just 5 times during the season with Hülkenberg's 7th-place finish at the {wikiLink("Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Australian_Grand_Prix")} being the team's best finish of the season.

        In August 2023, Haas announced that the 2023 driver lineup of {wikiLink("Hülkenberg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_H%C3%BClkenberg")} and {wikiLink("Magnussen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen")} will be retained for the 2024 season. On January 10, team principal {wikiLink("Guenther Steiner", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guenther_Steiner")}'s contract was not renewed, with the position being filled by engineer {wikiLink("Ayao Komatsu", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayao_Komatsu")}. Technical director {wikiLink("Simone Resta", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Resta")} also departed.
        </p>

        <p>
        In August 2024, it was reported that Haas has to reimburse US$9 million to former title sponsor Uralkali for the cancelled sponsorship contract by a Swiss arbitrator two months prior. This resulted in Dutch bailiffs and police entering the Haas paddock during the {wikiLink("Dutch Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Dutch_Grand_Prix")} weekend to valuate their assets for Uralkali to potentially seize should the company not receive payment by August 26. On August 23, Gene Haas confirmed the team has made the payment but it was complicated by the Russian sanctions. On August 26, Uralkali confirmed the receipt of the payment and Haas was allowed to leave for the {wikiLink("Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Italian_Grand_Prix")}.
        </p>

        <p>
        {wikiLink("Magnussen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen")} received two penalty points for causing a collision at the Italian Grand Prix, taking his total to twelve points in twelve months and triggering a one-race ban. Reserve driver {wikiLink("Oliver Bearman", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Bearman")} replaced him for the {wikiLink("Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")}.

        <p>
        On October 11, Haas and {wikiLink("Toyota Gazoo Racing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Gazoo_Racing")} (TGR) signed a technical partnership, where TGR will provide design, technical and manufacturing services whereas Haas will provide technical expertise and commercial benefits.

This is the first time that Haas has taken on a rookie driver since the pairing of Nikita Mazepin and Mick Schumacher in 2021. He was joined by {wikiLink("Esteban Ocon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon")}, who departed {wikiLink("Alpine", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team")} after five seasons with {wikiLink("Team Enstone", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Enstone")}.

        <p>
        The season opening race in {wikiLink("Melbourne", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Australian_Grand_Prix")} was an unwelcome surprise for Haas with both drivers. In qualifying, Ocon was last of the classified drivers in P19 with teammate Bearman not being classified due to gearbox issues. In the race, despite rain and chaotic conditions, both drivers were again at the back of the pack finishing P13 and P14 as the last of the classified drivers.
        </p>

        <p>
        In the second race in {wikiLink("China", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Chinese_Grand_Prix")}, both drivers were able to score points with Ocon and Bearman crossing the line in P7 and P10 respectively. This marked the first points of the season for the team, the first points for Ocon with Haas and with a Ferrari power unit, and the first double points finish for Haas since Mexico. After the race, the Ferrari duo of {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")} and {wikiLink("Charles Leclerc", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc")} were both disqualified as well as {wikiLink("Pierre Gasly", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gasly")} promoting Ocon and Bearman to P5 and P8 respectively.
