        <p>
        The team traces its roots to {wikiLink("Minardi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minardi")}, which competed in Formula One from 1985 to 2005, before being bought by {wikiLink("Red Bull", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_GmbH")} in 2006 to become the junior team to {wikiLink("Red Bull Racing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing")}. From 2006 to 2019, it competed as "{wikiLink("Toro Rosso", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Toro_Rosso")}" and was known for housing future Red Bull talent, such as future four-time World Champion {wikiLink("Sebastian Vettel", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel")}, former {wikiLink("Scuderia Ferrari", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari")} driver {wikiLink("Carlos Sainz Jr.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr.")}, and reigning four-time World Champion {wikiLink("Max Verstappen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen")}. In addition, Toro Rosso had previously employed 2023–24 driver {wikiLink("Daniel Ricciardo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo")} as part of its line-up in 2012 and 2013.
        </p>

        <p>
        For the {wikiLink("2020 Formula One World Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, Toro Rosso was rebranded to "AlphaTauri" in order to promote Red Bull's {wikiLink("AlphaTauri fashion brand", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaTauri_(fashion_brand)")}. According to {wikiLink("Franz Tost", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Tost")} and {wikiLink("Helmut Marko", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Marko")}, the rebrand to Scuderia AlphaTauri also acknowledged that it had transitioned from Red Bull Racing's junior team to its sister team.
        </p>

        <p>
        The team was rebranded to {wikiLink("Visa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Inc.")} {wikiLink("Cash App", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_App")} RB F1 Team for the 2024 season, shortened to the acronymised "VCARB". The new name was widely criticised by fans and the media, with Edd Straw of {wikiLink("The Race", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Race")} calling it "the worst team name in Formula 1 history" and "an embarrassment to Red Bull and Formula 1 as a whole", arguing that the name "RB" lacks "personality, identity and ambition", could easily be confused with Red Bull Racing, and exists solely to force the sponsors to be mentioned more often. For the {wikiLink("2025", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Formula_One_World_Championship")} season, the team was entered as "Racing Bulls", discontinuing the usage of the "RB" initialism.

        RB entered the 2024 Formula One World Championship with drivers {wikiLink("Daniel Ricciardo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo")} and {wikiLink("Yuki Tsunoda", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Tsunoda")}. The team continued using {wikiLink("Honda RBPT", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_RBPT")} power units, having used {wikiLink("Honda", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_F1")}-designed power units since the {wikiLink("2018 season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Formula_One_World_Championship")} when it was named {wikiLink("Scuderia Toro Rosso", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Toro_Rosso")}.

        <p>
        In the {wikiLink("2024 Chinese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Chinese_Grand_Prix")}, the team suffered a double retirement, caused by {wikiLink("Haas's", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haas_F1_Team")} {wikiLink("Kevin Magnussen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen")} crashing into {wikiLink("Yuki Tsunoda", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Tsunoda")} and {wikiLink("Daniel Ricciardo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo")}'s rear being struck by {wikiLink("Lance Stroll", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Stroll")}. Both drivers suffered major damage to their diffusers, with Ricciardo in particular being forced to retire a few laps later. Tsunoda suffered terminal rear-right damage and retired on the spot. Ahead of the {wikiLink("2024 United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_Grand_Prix")}, Ricciardo would leave the team and be replaced by reserve driver {wikiLink("Liam Lawson", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Lawson")} for the remainder of the season. Lawson would then be promoted to {wikiLink("Oracle Red Bull Racing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Red_Bull_Racing")} to replace the outgoing {wikiLink("Sergio Pérez", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P%C3%A9rez")} with his place being taken by F2 graduate and Red Bull Junior driver, {wikiLink("Isack Hadjar", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isack_Hadjar")}. However, Lawson returned to Racing Bulls after two Grands Prix with Red Bull, with Tsunoda being promoted up to the main team in his place.
