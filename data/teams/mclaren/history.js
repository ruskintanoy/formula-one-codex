        Bruce McLaren made the team's Grand Prix debut at the {wikiLink("1966 Monaco race", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966_Monaco_Grand_Prix")} (of the current Formula One teams, only {wikiLink("Ferrari", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari")} is older). His race ended after nine laps due to a terminal oil leak. The {wikiLink("1966", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966_Formula_One_season")} car was the {wikiLink("M2B", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_M2B")} designed by {wikiLink("Robin Herd", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Herd")}, but the programme was hampered by a poor choice of engines: a 3.0-litre version of {wikiLink("Ford", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company")}'s {wikiLink("Indianapolis 500", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500")} engine and a {wikiLink("Serenissima", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Serenissima")} {wikiLink("V8", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_engine")} were used, the latter scoring the team's first point in {wikiLink("Britain", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966_British_Grand_Prix")}, but both were underpowered and unreliable. For {wikiLink("1967", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_Formula_One_season")} Bruce decided to use a {wikiLink("British Racing Motors", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Racing_Motors")} (BRM) {wikiLink("V12 engine", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V12_engine")}, but due to delays with the engine, was forced initially to use a modified {wikiLink("Formula Two", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_Two")} car called the {wikiLink("M4B", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_M4B")} powered by a 2.1-litre BRM V8, later building a similar but slightly larger car called the {wikiLink("M5A", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_M5A")} for the V12. Neither car brought great success, the best result being a fourth at {wikiLink("Monaco", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}.

        For {wikiLink("1968", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Formula_One_season")}, after driving McLaren's sole entry for the previous two years, Bruce was joined by 1967 champion and fellow New Zealander {wikiLink("Denny Hulme", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny_Hulme")}, who was already racing for McLaren in {wikiLink("Can-Am", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can-Am")}. That year's new {wikiLink("M7A", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_M7A")} car, Herd's final design for the team, was powered by {wikiLink("Cosworth", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosworth")}'s new and soon to be ubiquitous {wikiLink("DFV", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosworth_DFV")} engine (the DFV would go on to be used by McLaren until 1983) and with it a major upturn in form proceeded. Bruce won the {wikiLink("Race of Champions", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_of_Champions_(Brands_Hatch)")} at the {wikiLink("Brands Hatch", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brands_Hatch")} circuit and Hulme won the {wikiLink("International Trophy", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_BRDC_International_Trophy")} at {wikiLink("Silverstone", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit")}, both non-championship races, before Bruce took the team's first championship win at the {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}. Hulme also won the {wikiLink("Italian", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Italian_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Canadian", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Canadian_Grand_Prix")} Grands Prix later in the year, helping the team to second in the Constructors' Championship. Using an updated 'C' version on the M7, a further three podium finishes followed for Bruce in {wikiLink("1969", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_Formula_One_season")}, but the team's fifth win had to wait until the last race of the 1969 championship when Hulme won the {wikiLink("Mexican Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_Mexican_Grand_Prix")}. That year, McLaren experimented with {wikiLink("four-wheel drive", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-wheel_drive")} in the {wikiLink("M9A", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_M9A")}, but the car had only a single outing driven by {wikiLink("Derek Bell", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Bell_(auto_racer)")} at the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_British_Grand_Prix")}; Bruce described driving it as like "trying to write your signature with somebody jogging your elbow".

        The year {wikiLink("1970", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Formula_One_season")} started with a second-place each for Hulme and Bruce in the first two Grands Prix, but in June, Bruce was killed in a crash at {wikiLink("Goodwood", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwood_Circuit")} while testing the new M8D Can-Am car. After his death, {wikiLink("Teddy Mayer", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Mayer")} took over effective control of the team; Hulme continued with {wikiLink("Dan Gurney", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gurney")} and {wikiLink("Peter Gethin", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gethin")} partnering him. Gurney won the first two Can-Am events at Mosport and St. Jovite and placed ninth in the third, but left the team mid-season, and Gethin took over from there. While {wikiLink("1971", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Formula_One_season")} began promisingly when Hulme led the opening round in {wikiLink("South Africa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_South_African_Grand_Prix")} before retiring with broken suspension, ultimately Hulme, Gethin (who left for BRM mid-season) and {wikiLink("Jackie Oliver", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Oliver")} again failed to score a win. The 1972 season saw improvements though: Hulme won the team's first Grand Prix for 2½ years in {wikiLink("South Africa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_South_African_Grand_Prix")} and he and {wikiLink("Peter Revson", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Revson")} scored ten other podiums, the team finishing third in the Constructors' Championship. McLaren gave {wikiLink("Jody Scheckter", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jody_Scheckter")} his Formula One debut at the {wikiLink("final race", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_United_States_Grand_Prix")} at {wikiLink("Watkins Glen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watkins_Glen_International")}. All McLaren drivers used the Ford-Cosworth engines, except for {wikiLink("Andrea de Adamich", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_de_Adamich")} and {wikiLink("Nanni Galli", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanni_Galli")} who used engines from {wikiLink("Alfa Romeo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfa_Romeo_in_Formula_One")} in 1970.

        The {wikiLink("McLaren M23", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_M23")}, designed by Gordon Coppuck, was the team's new car for the {wikiLink("1973", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Formula_One_season")} season. Sharing parts of the design of both McLaren's Formula One {wikiLink("M19", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_M19A")} and Indianapolis M16 cars (itself inspired by {wikiLink("Lotus", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Lotus")}'s {wikiLink("72", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_72")}), it was a mainstay for four years. Hulme won with it in {wikiLink("Sweden", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Swedish_Grand_Prix")} and Revson took the only Grand Prix wins of his career in {wikiLink("Britain", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_British_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Canada", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Canadian_Grand_Prix")}. In {wikiLink("1974", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Formula_One_season")}, {wikiLink("Emerson Fittipaldi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_Fittipaldi")}, world champion with Lotus two years earlier, joined McLaren. Hulme, in his final Formula One campaign, won the {wikiLink("Argentinian", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Argentine_Grand_Prix")} season-opener; Fittipaldi, with wins in {wikiLink("Brazil", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Brazilian_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("Belgium", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Belgian_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Canada", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Canadian_Grand_Prix")}, took the Drivers' Championship. It was a close fight for Fittipaldi, who secured the title with a fourth at the season-ending {wikiLink("United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_United_States_Grand_Prix")}, putting him three points ahead of Ferrari's {wikiLink("Clay Regazzoni", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Regazzoni")}. With Hulme and multiple motorcycle world champion {wikiLink("Mike Hailwood", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Hailwood")}, he also sealed McLaren's first Constructors' Championship. The year {wikiLink("1975", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_Formula_One_season")} was less successful for the team: Fittipaldi was second in the championship behind {wikiLink("Niki Lauda", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niki_Lauda")}. Hulme's replacement {wikiLink("Jochen Mass", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jochen_Mass")} took his sole GP win in {wikiLink("Spain", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Spanish_Grand_Prix")}.

        At the end of {wikiLink("1975", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_Formula_One_season")}, Fittipaldi left to join his brother's {wikiLink("Fittipaldi/Copersucar", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fittipaldi_Automotive")} team. With the top drivers already signed to other teams, Mayer turned to {wikiLink("James Hunt", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hunt")}, a driver on whom biographer Gerald Donaldson reflected as having "a dubious reputation". In {wikiLink("1976", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Formula_One_season")}, Lauda was again strong in his Ferrari; at midseason, he led the championship with 56 points while Hunt had only 26 despite wins in {wikiLink("Spain", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Spanish_Grand_Prix")} (a race from which he was initially disqualified) and {wikiLink("France", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_French_Grand_Prix")}. At the {wikiLink("German Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_German_Grand_Prix")}, though, Lauda crashed heavily, was nearly killed, and missed the next two races. Hunt capitalised by winning four more Grands Prix giving him a three-point deficit going into the finale in {wikiLink("Japan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}. Here it rained torrentially, Lauda retired because of safety concerns, and Hunt sealed the Drivers' Championship by finishing third. McLaren, though, lost the Constructors' Championship to Ferrari.

        In {wikiLink("1977", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_Formula_One_season")}, the M23 was gradually replaced with the {wikiLink("M26", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_M26")}, the M23's final works outing being {wikiLink("Gilles Villeneuve", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Villeneuve")}'s Formula One debut with the team in a one-off appearance at the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_British_Grand_Prix")}. Hunt won on three occasions that year, but the Lauda and Ferrari combination proved too strong, Hunt and McLaren managing just fifth and third in the respective championships. From there, results continued to worsen. Lotus and {wikiLink("Mario Andretti", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Andretti")} took the {wikiLink("1978", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_Formula_One_season")} titles with their {wikiLink("78", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_78")} and {wikiLink("79", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_79")} {wikiLink("ground-effect", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_effect_in_cars")} cars and neither Hunt nor Mass's replacement {wikiLink("Patrick Tambay", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Tambay")} were able to seriously challenge with the non-ground-effect M26. Hunt was dropped at the end of 1978 in favour of Lotus's {wikiLink("Ronnie Peterson", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Peterson")}, but when Peterson was killed by a crash at the {wikiLink("Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_Italian_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("John Watson", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Watson_(racing_driver)")} was signed, instead.

Tambay scored no points and Watson only 15 to place the team eighth at the end of the year.

        The 1980s started much as the 1970s had ended: {wikiLink("Alain Prost", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Prost")} took over from Tambay but Watson and he rarely scored points. Under increasing pressure since the previous year from principal sponsor {wikiLink("Philip Morris", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altria_Group")} and their executive {wikiLink("John Hogan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hogan_(motorsport_executive)")}, Mayer was coerced into merging McLaren with {wikiLink("Ron Dennis", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Dennis")}'s Project Four Formula Two team, also sponsored by Philip Morris. Dennis had designer {wikiLink("John Barnard", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Barnard")} who, inspired by the {wikiLink("carbon-fibre", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fibre")} rear wings of the {wikiLink("BMW M1", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_M1")} race cars that Project Four was preparing, had ideas for an innovative Formula One chassis constructed from carbon-fibre instead of conventional {wikiLink("aluminium alloy", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_alloy")}. On their own, they lacked the money to build it, but with investment that came with the merger it became the {wikiLink("McLaren MP4", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MP4/1")} (later called MP4/1) of {wikiLink("1981", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, driven by Watson and {wikiLink("Andrea de Cesaris", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_de_Cesaris")}. In the MP4, Watson won the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_British_Grand_Prix")} and had three other podium finishes. Soon after the merger, McLaren moved from Colnbrook to a new base in Woking and Dennis and Mayer initially shared the managing directorship of the company; by 1982, Mayer had departed and Tyler Alexander's and his shareholdings had been bought by the new owners.

Having seen in 1982 the need for a turbo engine of their own, Dennis had convinced {wikiLink("Williams", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Grand_Prix_Engineering")} backer {wikiLink("Techniques d'Avant Garde", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techniques_d%27Avant_Garde")} to fund {wikiLink("Porsche", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_in_motorsport")}-built, TAG-branded turbo engines made to Barnard's specifications; TAG's founder {wikiLink("Mansour Ojjeh", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansour_Ojjeh")} would later become a McLaren shareholder. In the meantime, they continued with Cosworth engines as old rival Lauda came out of retirement in 1982 to drive alongside Watson in that year's 1B development of the MP4. They each won two races, Watson notably from 17th place on the grid in {wikiLink("Detroit", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_Detroit_Grand_Prix")}, and at one stage of the season McLaren were second in the constructors' championship. As part of a dispute with {wikiLink("FISA", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_Internationale_du_Sport_Automobile")}, they boycotted the {wikiLink("San Marino Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_San_Marino_Grand_Prix")}. Although {wikiLink("1983", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Formula_One_World_Championship")} was not so fruitful, Watson did win again in the United States, this time from 22nd on the grid at {wikiLink("Long Beach", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_United_States_Grand_Prix_West")}.

        Having been fired by Renault, Prost returned to McLaren once again for {wikiLink("1984", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. Now using the TAG engines, the team dominated, scoring 12 wins and 2½ times as many constructors' points as nearest rival Ferrari. In the Drivers' Championship, Lauda prevailed over Prost by half a point, the narrowest margin ever. The McLaren-TAGs were again strong in {wikiLink("1985", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_Formula_One_World_Championship")}; a third Constructors' Championship came their way while this time Prost won the Drivers' Championship. In {wikiLink("1986", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, the {wikiLink("Williams", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Grand_Prix_Engineering")} team were resurgent with their {wikiLink("Honda", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_in_Formula_One")} engine and drivers {wikiLink("Nigel Mansell", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Mansell")} and {wikiLink("Nelson Piquet", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Piquet")}, while at McLaren, Lauda's replacement, 1982 champion {wikiLink("Keke Rosberg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keke_Rosberg")} could not gel with the car. Williams took the Constructors' Championship, but for Prost, wins in {wikiLink("San Marino", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_San_Marino_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("Monaco", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}, and {wikiLink("Austria", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_Austrian_Grand_Prix")} combined with the fact that the Williams drivers were taking points from each other meant that he retained a chance going into the last race, the {wikiLink("Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_Australian_Grand_Prix")}. There, a puncture for Mansell and a precautionary pit stop for Piquet gave Prost the race win and his second title, making him the first driver to win back-to-back championships since {wikiLink("Jack Brabham", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Brabham")} in {wikiLink("1959", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1959_Formula_One_season")} and 1960. In {wikiLink("1987", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, Barnard departed for Ferrari to be replaced by {wikiLink("Steve Nichols", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Nichols")}. In the hands of Prost and {wikiLink("Stefan Johansson", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Johansson")}, though, Nichols's {wikiLink("MP4/3", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MP4/3")} and the TAG engine could not match the Williams-Honda.

        For {wikiLink("1988", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, Honda switched their supply to McLaren and, encouraged by Prost, Dennis signed {wikiLink("Ayrton Senna", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrton_Senna")} to drive. Despite regulations reducing the boost pressure and fuel capacity (and therefore, power) of the turbo cars, Honda persisted with a turbocharged engine. In the {wikiLink("MP4/4", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MP4/4")}, Senna and Prost engaged in a season-long battle, winning 15 of the 16 races (at the other race at {wikiLink("Monza", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Italian_Grand_Prix")}, Senna had been leading comfortably, but collided with back-marker {wikiLink("Jean-Louis Schlesser", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Schlesser")}). At the {wikiLink("Portuguese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Portuguese_Grand_Prix")}, their relationship soured when Senna squeezed Prost against the pit wall; Prost won, but afterwards said, "It was dangerous. If he wants the world championship that badly he can have it." Prost scored more points that year, but because only the best 11 results counted, Senna took the title at the penultimate race in {wikiLink("Japan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}.

        The next year, with turbos banned, Honda supplied a new 3.5-L naturally aspirated {wikiLink("V10 engine", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V10_engine")} and McLaren again won both titles with the {wikiLink("MP4/5", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MP4/5")}. Their drivers' relationship continued to deteriorate, though, especially when, at the {wikiLink("San Marino Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_San_Marino_Grand_Prix")}, Prost felt that Senna had reneged on an agreement not to pass each other at the first corner. Believing that Honda and Dennis were favouring Senna, Prost announced mid-season that he would leave to drive at Ferrari the following year. For the second year in succession, the Drivers' Championship was decided at the {wikiLink("Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}, this time in Prost's favour after Senna and he collided (Senna initially recovered and won the race, but was later disqualified).

        In {wikiLink("2006", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, the superior reliability and speed of the Ferraris and Renaults prevented the team from gaining any victories for the first time in a decade. Montoya parted company acrimoniously with the team to race in {wikiLink("NASCAR", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR")} after the {wikiLink("United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_United_States_Grand_Prix")}, where he crashed into Räikkönen at the start; test driver {wikiLink("Pedro de la Rosa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_de_la_Rosa")} deputised for the remainder of the season. The team also lost Räikkönen to Ferrari at the end of the year.

        <p>
        {wikiLink("Steve Matchett", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Matchett")} argued that the poor reliability of McLaren in 2006 and recent previous years was due to a lack of team continuity and stability. His cited examples of instability are logistical challenges related to the move to the {wikiLink("McLaren Technology Centre", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_Technology_Centre")}, Adrian Newey's aborted move to {wikiLink("Jaguar", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_Racing")} and later move to Red Bull, the subsequent move of Newey's deputy to Red Bull, and personnel changes at Ilmor.

        After scoring no victories in 2006, the team returned to competitive status in {wikiLink("2007", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Formula_One_World_Championship")}. That year saw Fernando Alonso race alongside Formula One debutant and long-time McLaren protégé {wikiLink("Lewis Hamilton", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton")}. The pair scored four wins each and led the Drivers' Championship for much of the year, but tensions arose within the team, BBC Sport claimed that Alonso was unable to cope with Hamilton's competitiveness. At the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}, Alonso was judged to have deliberately impeded his teammate during qualifying, so the team were not allowed to score Constructors' points at the event. An internal agreement within the McLaren team stated that drivers would alternatively have an extra lap for qualifying, however, Lewis Hamilton refused to accept for the Hungarian Grand Prix. Subsequently, the McLaren team was investigated by the {wikiLink("FIA", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA")} for having proprietary technical blueprints of Ferrari's car – the {wikiLink("so-called 'Spygate' controversy", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Formula_One_espionage_controversy")}. At the first hearing, McLaren management consistently denied all knowledge, blaming a single "rogue engineer". However, in the final hearing, McLaren was found guilty and the team was excluded from the Constructors' Championship and fined $100 million. The drivers were allowed to continue without penalty, and while Hamilton led the Drivers' Championship heading into the final race in {wikiLink("Brazil", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Brazilian_Grand_Prix")}, Räikkönen in the Ferrari won the race and the Drivers' Championship, a single point ahead of both McLaren drivers. In November, Alonso and McLaren agreed to terminate their contract by mutual consent, {wikiLink("Heikki Kovalainen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heikki_Kovalainen")} filling the vacant seat alongside Hamilton.

        In {wikiLink("2008", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, a close fight ensued between Hamilton and the Ferraris of {wikiLink("Felipe Massa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Massa")} and Räikkönen; Hamilton won five times and despite also crossing the finish line first at the {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}, he was deemed to have gained an illegal advantage by cutting a chicane during an overtake and was controversially demoted to third.

        For the {wikiLink("2010 season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, McLaren lost its status as the Mercedes works team; Mercedes decided to buy the Brackley-based {wikiLink("Brawn", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brawn_GP")} team that had won the 2009 titles with its customer engines, Whitmarsh having chosen to abandon their exclusive rights to the Mercedes engines to help Brawn run.

        Hamilton and Button remained with the team into {wikiLink("2011", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, with Hamilton winning three races – {wikiLink("China", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Chinese_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("Germany", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_German_Grand_Prix")}, and {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")} and Button also winning three races – {wikiLink("Canada", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Canadian_Grand_Prix")}, {wikiLink("Hungary", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}, and {wikiLink("Japan", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}.

McLaren was second in the Constructors' Championship to Red Bull Racing.

        In {wikiLink("2012", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, McLaren won the first race of the year in {wikiLink("Australia", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Australian_Grand_Prix")} with a dominant victory by Button and a 3rd place from pole for Hamilton, while Hamilton went on to win in {wikiLink("Canada", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Canadian_Grand_Prix")}, but by the mid-way mark of the season at the team's home race at Silverstone, the McLaren cars managed only eighth place (Hamilton) and 10th place (Button), while the drivers' and Constructors' Championships were being dominated by Red Bull Racing and Ferrari, whose cars occupied the first four places of the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_British_Grand_Prix")}, this was partially due to pit stop problems and Button's temporary dip in form after not adapting as well as Hamilton to the new Pirelli tyres. The car also suffered reliability problems which cost the team and its drivers numerous potential points, most notably in {wikiLink("Singapore", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Singapore_Grand_Prix")} and {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}, where Hamilton had been leading from the front in both races and in Italy where the team lost a 1-2 finish when Button's car failed with fuel problems on lap 33.

        For {wikiLink("2015", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, McLaren ended their engine deal with Mercedes which included buying back the 40% stake that Mercedes held in the team and reforging their historical partnership with Honda. The Honda deal not only meant they would supply engines, but that Honda staff would work with the team at their Woking base as well as received full-factory support from Honda including official team vehicles and free engines. The team announced {wikiLink("Fernando Alonso", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso")} and {wikiLink("Jenson Button", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenson_Button")} as their race drivers, with {wikiLink("Kevin Magnussen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen")} demoted to test driver. During pre-season testing at the {wikiLink("Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_Barcelona-Catalunya")} in February, Alonso suffered a concussion and, as a result, Magnussen replaced him for the season-opening {wikiLink("Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Australian_Grand_Prix")} in March. At that inaugural race of the season, Button finished 11th, but was lapped twice and finished last of the finishing cars. Following considerable unreliability and initial suggestions that the Honda engine was underpowered relative to its competitors, steady performance gains eventually resulted in Button managing to score the team's first (four) points of the season at the sixth round in {wikiLink("Monaco", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Monaco_Grand_Prix")}. By contrast, Alonso scored his first point three races later at the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_British_Grand_Prix")}.

        McLaren retained the Alonso - Button pairing for the {wikiLink("2016", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Formula_One_World_Championship")} season. The second year of the Honda partnership was better than the first, with the team being able to challenge for top 10 positions on a more regular basis. However, the season started with a massive crash at the {wikiLink("2016 Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Australian_Grand_Prix")} in which {wikiLink("Fernando Alonso", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso")} sustained rib fractures and a {wikiLink("collapsed lung", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapsed_lung")} after colliding with {wikiLink("Esteban Gutiérrez", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Gutiérrez")} and somersaulting into the crash barriers. Alonso, as a result of his injuries, was forced to miss the second round of the Championship, the {wikiLink("2016 Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")}, and was replaced by reserve driver {wikiLink("Stoffel Vandoorne", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoffel_Vandoorne")}. Vandoorne produced an impressive performance in his first race to score the team's first point of the season with 10th place. The next points for McLaren came at the {wikiLink("2016 Russian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Russian_Grand_Prix")} with Alonso and Button finishing sixth and 10th respectively. The rain-affected {wikiLink("2016 Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Monaco_Grand_Prix")} was one of best races of the season for the team. Alonso finished fifth, having kept {wikiLink("Nico Rosberg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Rosberg")}'s Mercedes behind him for 46 laps, while Button scored two points with ninth. At the {wikiLink("2016 Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Austrian_Grand_Prix")}, Button recorded his best result of the season with a sixth-place after qualifying third in a wet/dry session. After a disappointing display at their home race, the {wikiLink("2016 British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_British_Grand_Prix")} at Silverstone, the team scored points at the next three rounds with six points in Hungary, four in Germany, and six points again thanks to an impressive seventh-place finish from Alonso at the {wikiLink("2016 Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}. At the {wikiLink("2016 United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_Grand_Prix")}, McLaren matched their Monaco result with 12 points after an attacking race from Alonso saw him claim fifth position while Button once again finished ninth. After a season of significant progress compared to 2015, Alonso and Button finished the championship in 10th and 15th places respectively with the team ending the season in sixth place in the Constructors' Championship with 76 points. On 3 September 2016, {wikiLink("Jenson Button", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenson_Button")} announced he would take a sabbatical from Formula One for the 2017 season.

        At the season-opening {wikiLink("2018 Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, Fernando Alonso scored the team's best finish since the {wikiLink("2016 Monaco Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Monaco_Grand_Prix")} with fifth, Alonso said that the team's target would be Red Bull Racing. McLaren had a relatively good start to the season with points finishes in the next four races, but in the next 16 races after Spain, McLaren only scored 22 points, 8 points less than in the same period in 2017. On 14 August 2018, Fernando Alonso announced he would not compete in Formula One in 2019, ending his four-year spell at the team. {wikiLink("Carlos Sainz Jr.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr.")} was signed as his replacement on a multi-year deal. On 3 September 2018, it was announced that {wikiLink("Stoffel Vandoorne", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoffel_Vandoorne")} would be leaving the team at the end of the season, with {wikiLink("Lando Norris", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris")} being promoted from reserve driver to replace him in 2019. McLaren struggled with performance throughout the season, with the McLaren drivers being knocked out 21 times in the first qualifying session, and McLaren having the second-worst average qualifying ranking of any team, only ahead of {wikiLink("Williams", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Grand_Prix_Engineering")}. The team finished the disappointing season – after being helped by the exclusion of {wikiLink("Force India", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_India")}'s points from the first 12 races – in 6th place with 62 points, 357 points behind their target, Red Bull Racing, with the same engine.

        <p>
        The {wikiLink("2019 season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Formula_One_World_Championship")} was much more positive for McLaren, with the team securely establishing themselves as the best constructor behind Mercedes, Ferrari, and Red Bull. At the {wikiLink("2019 Brazilian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Brazilian_Grand_Prix")}, Sainz recorded the team's first podium since the {wikiLink("2014 Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Australian_Grand_Prix")}, finishing fourth on the road but later promoted to third after Lewis Hamilton received a post-race penalty, meaning that the team missed out on the official podium ceremony. McLaren ended the season in 4th place with 145 points, their best result since 2014 and 54 points ahead of their nearest competitor, Renault.

Norris secured the team's first pole position in the hybrid era at the {wikiLink("2021 Russian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Russian_Grand_Prix")} but was unable to convert it to a win, finishing in seventh place due to the sudden drastic change in weather conditions and team strategy in the last two laps of the race. A subsequent drop in form in the latter part of the season saw McLaren ending up fourth in the constructors' championship behind Ferrari.
        </p>

        <p>
        For the {wikiLink("2022 Formula One World Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Formula_One_World_Championship")}, McLaren retained both Norris and Ricciardo. Ricciardo tested positive for {wikiLink("COVID-19", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19")} ahead of the pre-season tests in Bahrain, which meant Norris was required to do all the remaining running for the test, although a brake problem limited the testing he was able to conduct.

Norris achieved third at the {wikiLink("2022 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix")}. After Norris missed the first day at the track during the {wikiLink("2022 São Paulo Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix")}, McLaren suffered their first double DNF since Monaco 2017 as Norris had an electrical fault and Ricciardo collided with {wikiLink("Haas", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haas_F1_Team")}' Kevin Magnussen. Compared to his teammate, Ricciardo struggled and received criticism, with some suggesting McLaren would drop him. This led Ricciardo to release a statement on Instagram confirming he would stay through to 2023. In August 2022, Ricciardo's contract for 2023 was terminated by mutual agreement. {wikiLink("Oscar Piastri", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri")} replaced Ricciardo for the 2023 season after a contract dispute with {wikiLink("Alpine", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team")} was resolved in McLaren's favour by the {wikiLink("FIA Contract Recognition Board", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA_Contract_Recognition_Board")}.

        The {wikiLink("2023 season", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Formula_One_World_Championship")} celebrated the 60th anniversary of the team's founding, with the car named the {wikiLink("MCL60", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MCL60")} in commemoration. The season started with several issues, prompting organizational changes after the {wikiLink("Saudi Arabian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix")}, including replacing James Key with a new Technical Executive Team. Norris and {wikiLink("Oscar Piastri", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri")} scored McLaren's first points of the season in Australia, with sixth and eighth place finishes. At the {wikiLink("Spanish Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Spanish_Grand_Prix")}, Norris qualified third but finished 17th due to early contact with Hamilton, while Piastri finished 13th.
        </p>

        <p>
        McLaren introduced upgrades at the {wikiLink("Austrian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Austrian_Grand_Prix")} for Norris and at the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_British_Grand_Prix")} for Piastri. Despite a tough sprint, Norris finished fourth in the race after post-race penalties promoted him. At Silverstone, Norris and Piastri qualified second and third, and Norris overtook {wikiLink("Max Verstappen", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen")} at the start to briefly lead. Norris ultimately finished second, with Piastri fourth—his best result at that time. Norris then secured another podium in Hungary, while Piastri finished fifth after sustaining floor damage.
       
        At the {wikiLink("Belgian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Belgian_Grand_Prix")}, Piastri qualified second in the sprint shootout and led briefly before finishing second in the sprint. Norris finished sixth. These results marked a significant turnaround for McLaren after their tough start to the year.
        </p>

        <p>
        McLaren introduced further upgrades to the MCL60 at the {wikiLink("2023 Singapore Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Singapore_Grand_Prix")}, where Piastri, having been impeded by Lance Stroll's heavy crash, started seventeenth with Norris in fourth. Both cars would make their way up the Marina Bay Street Circuit; Piastri recovered ten places to finish seventh, while Norris took advantage of George Russell finding the walls and the assistance of his former teammate and race leader Carlos Sainz Jr. to finish second. At the {wikiLink("2023 Japanese Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Japanese_Grand_Prix")}, Norris and Piastri finished in second and third respectively, giving McLaren their first double podium finish of the season and their first since the 2021 Italian Grand Prix. This is also Piastri's first podium finish in Formula One. Piastri won the {wikiLink("2023 Qatar Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Qatar_Grand_Prix")} sprint race, marking McLaren's first sprint race victory in Formula One; both would recover from lower grid positions in the main race to finish second and third respectively. It was in this race that McLaren recorded the fastest pit stop in Formula One, setting a pit stop time of 1.80 seconds, 0.02 quicker than the previous record set by Red Bull Racing in the {wikiLink("2019 Brazilian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Brazilian_Grand_Prix")}. At the {wikiLink("United States Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Grand_Prix")} Norris and Piastri finished fourth and fifth respectively in the sprint, while Norris finished third in the main race, only to be promoted to second after Hamilton's car was found to be illegal in post race inspections, with Piastri retiring on lap 10 from a damaged intercooler after contact with Ocon on lap 1. The {wikiLink("Mexican Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Grand_Prix")} saw Norris knocked out in Q1 after being unable to set a competitive lap time, due to mistakes and yellow flags. The team decided against running a fresh power unit and incurring penalties despite the low grid position and losing some engine components at the first race in Bahrain and Norris recovered to a brilliant fifth-place finish, ahead of Piastri in eighth. The {wikiLink("Brazilian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Grand_Prix")} saw Norris take pole for the sprint race with Piastri in tenth, but only could convert that to a second and tenth-place finish respectively. Norris started the race in sixth with Piastri again in tenth. A very good start saw Norris jump to second by the first corner, where he remained for the rest of the race. Meanwhile, Piastri got caught up in a turn one incident which damaged his rear wing and diffuser, the team was able to repair his car under the red flag, but due to needing to pit immediately while the rest of the cars went around for another lap under the safety car he ended up a lap down. He eventually finished in 16th, two laps down.
        </p>

        <p>
        The {wikiLink("Las Vegas Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Grand_Prix")} saw a double Q1 elimination for the first time since Miami earlier in the year, this being down to the team electing against using a second set of softs for their final runs. The race was not any much better; Norris suffered his first retirement of the season on lap 3 after a heavy crash going around the eleventh corner with his car bottoming out over the bumps, with the car heavy on fuel and the tyre pressures low from the lack of temperature. Norris was admitted to a hospital for precautionary checks but was released soon after. Meanwhile, Piastri fought valiantly up the grid. However, on lap 17 he collided with Hamilton, causing a puncture. Having started on hards, he boxed to hards again in hope for a late safety car. Unfortunately for him, the safety car came out 10 laps later, on lap 27 of 50; at that point, the medium tyres could not be run for that long optimally. At the restart, he was 4th and showed impressive pace against the front runners, staying out until lap 44 to build an overcut on those behind. He would then switch to the mediums and come out twelfth, where he fought up to eventually finish in tenth with the fastest lap. During the {wikiLink("2023 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")} weekend, McLaren signed an extension to use Mercedes engines until 2030. For the race, Piastri started third with Norris in fifth after a mistake on his final run in Q3 cost him a likely front row. The cars finished the race in fifth for Norris and sixth for Piastri, rounding off the 2023 season for McLaren, seeing them take fourth place in the constructors' championship, with Norris taking sixth and Piastri taking ninth in the drivers' championship.

        The success of the MCL60 provided McLaren, who finished the 2023 season in fourth, allowing for more testing time, numerous opportunities to capitalise in performance for the {wikiLink("2024", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Formula_One_World_Championship")} season. Retaining Norris and Piastri, the team hired {wikiLink("David Sanchez", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sanchez_(engineer)")} from {wikiLink("Scuderia Ferrari", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari")} to lead development alongside {wikiLink("Peter Prodromou", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Prodromou")} and {wikiLink("Neil Houldey", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Houldey")} (after a restructuring, {wikiLink("Rob Marshall", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Marshall_(motorsport)")} would lead development) for the 2024 car, titled the {wikiLink("MCL38", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MCL38")}. The MCL38 marked the first design to be developed in the in-house McLaren wind tunnel.

        Team principal Andrea Stella set three goals for development of the MCL38, including improving aerodynamic efficiency, mechanical grip, tyre performance, and overall driveability, which had been a long-standing problem of McLaren cars; the latter issue was exacerbated with the mid-season upgrades introduced to the MCL60. Stella theorised that field-leading {wikiLink("Red Bull Racing", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing")}, who had dominated the 2023 season, had built up a backlog of upgrades for the {wikiLink("RB20", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing_RB20")}.

        The {wikiLink("MCL38", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MCL38")} was first introduced at the {wikiLink("2024 Bahrain Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bahrain_Grand_Prix")} and took its first podium with Norris at the {wikiLink("2024 Australian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Australian_Grand_Prix")}; by this point, the MCL38 proved to be the third-fastest car overall behind Ferrari's {wikiLink("SF-24", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_SF-24")}. The SF-24 had superior tyre management, but the MCL38 excelled in qualifying. McLaren revealed a substantial upgrade package that would be utilised for the {wikiLink("Miami Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Miami_Grand_Prix")}. The upgrade's success would be confirmed after Norris took the lead from Verstappen and went on to win the race, marking his maiden Formula One career victory. McLaren expected the upgrades to improve the car's performance across all conditions; the upgrade was much more successful than expected, to the point the team needed to investigate it.

        The MCL38 displayed consistency following the Miami victory, with either driver being a constant presence on the podium; by the {wikiLink("British Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_British_Grand_Prix")}, the MCL38 had been established as the fastest car. Of these successes included a 1–2 finish at the {wikiLink("Hungarian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Hungarian_Grand_Prix")}, McLaren's first since the {wikiLink("2021 Italian Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Italian_Grand_Prix")}. A mid-season upgrade introduced for the {wikiLink("Dutch Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Dutch_Grand_Prix")} further improved performance, with Norris winning by over 27 seconds ahead of second-placed Verstappen. Piastri's triumph at the {wikiLink("Azerbaijan Grand Prix", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix")} moved McLaren up to first in the {wikiLink("World Constructors' Championship", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_World_Constructors%27_Champions")}. This was the first time since {wikiLink("2014", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Formula_One_World_Championship")} that McLaren had led the WCC. In {wikiLink("Abu Dhabi", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix")}, Norris finished in first to win McLaren's first World Constructors' Championship since 1998.
